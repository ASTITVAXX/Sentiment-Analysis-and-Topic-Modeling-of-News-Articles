On Friday, when she came there with her family after two years, Kartavya Path mesmerised her. It is amazing to see the redeveloped Central Vista. When we came earlier, there was a lot of dust. Now, the sandy area has now been covered with grasses,"" said Chandra, whose daughter was busy clicking pictures of the newly installed statue of Subhas Chandra Bose.

After Kartavya Path was inaugurated on Thursday after 19 months of closure to the public, people made a beeline for the revamped spot. Though police said 5,000-7,000 people visited Kartavya Path on Friday, the number of visitors is expected to go up substantially over the weekend.

One of the main highlights on Friday night was a drone show on the life of Netaji organised by the Union ministry of culture.

The skies above India Gate were filled with colourful drones that formed images of Netaji and his slogan of 'Jai Hind'. The drone show will also be held on Saturday and Sunday. Visitor Huma Khan said she found the drone show spectacular.
Another attraction was the cultural show featuring folk artistes from various states. Shanu Kori of Madhya Pradesh, said, I am very happy to perform in our country's capital in front of such a big crowd. It is an honour for us and we performed a traditional dance of Bundelkhand.""
As the revamped site was opened to the public after a lengthy gap, there was excitement among people who gaped at the new features of the popular green area. Pranav Kumar and his wife Pooja, who came with their two children, said they were having a good time walking on the pathways. It is one the best open spaces in the city to spend quality time with children,"" the couple said.
Manish Kumar was accompanied by his family. He said the lighting, walkways, parking zones and other amenities introduced here have given a new look to the place and seemed appropriate with the changing times.
Major additions at the India Gate complex are the four pedestrian underpasses. These interconnect across the lawns so that visitors do not have to cross Kartavya Path. If earlier the visitors faced problems in crossing the roads at the C-Hexagon and Rajpath, they can now safely use the underpasses, which also have boards depicting the new features and changes on Kartavya Path.
Police said the traffic was not hampered on Friday because the pedestrians used the underpasses and the autorickshaws did not have to stop on the road, thus ensuring smooth flow of traffic. Several police teams were deployed to prevent traffic snarls created by autorickshaws idling ahead of Kartavya Path.",Revamped Central Vista opens to the public | Delhi News - Times of India,9,2022

This will be a day after the stretch is inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

When people stream into the area this weekend, they will discover several new facilities and be subjected to some restrictions as well. Vendors, including the ubiquitous ice-cream carts, will be allowed only at the designated vending zones along the lawns and parking for 1,117 cars and 35 buses will be available.
However, no picnic like affairs will be allowed on the lawns between Rajpath and the refurbished canals. Officials said visitors will be allowed to do so only in the sections behind the canals where children can also play.

Walking on the lawns will not be prohibited but people will be discouraged from doing so and asked to use only the pathways.
The boating services at the two canals ""behind Krishi Bhawan and the newly-built Vanijya Bhawan "" will be resumed soon. We are restoring all facilities that people enjoyed and also adding more,"" said an official.
On the inauguration day, visitors won't be allowed on the stretch from India Gate to the Man Singh Road crossing. From Friday, however, the entire stretch will be opened. The Prime Minister will inaugurate the stretch and unveil a statue of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose after sunset.
There will be strong police deployment for a month because footfalls are likely to be high after the stretch is opened. The CPWD has installed 300 advanced CCTV cameras for live monitoring and artificial intelligence algorithms will be used for preventive security. All visitors going to India Gate and the Netaji statue will be subjected to a security check.
Officials said they do not want any loss of livelihood for people who have been carrying on their small businesses around India Gate. Vendors and ice-cream shops will be allowed at five vending zones that can accommodate around 200 such activities. We will see how things take shape and then do the needful. Sixteen kiosks on both sides of India Gate have been allotted to state governments to put up their stalls. Most of these will be selling state-specific food items,"" said an official.
Cars will be allowed to be parked without a charge initially but later NDMC will be managing the parking lots and collect a fee.
Officials said that maintaining the entire area will be a challenge and they will appeal to people to observe cleanliness. We also welcome organisations that want to contribute in creating awareness among the visitors. Maintaining the area has to be a people's initiative,"" said an official.
The redevelopment work had started in Feb 2021. The project was delayed due to several reasons, including Covid-19, prolonged rain that year and issues with the irrigation system.
Officials said they are now working on a plan to minimise the time taken for preparing for the Republic Day celebrations and to ensure that the lawns aren't damaged during such preparations. By 2024, setting up the dais for the President and dignitaries and arrangements for the public will be done with pre-fabricated modules.","Central Vista: Vending zones, parking and pathways for visitors | Delhi News - Times of India",9,2022

A team of six NBRI experts, led by NBRI director SK Barik, has begun work on developing five green tracks on the theme of the first war of Independence (1857 Uprising), Santhal rebellion, Dandi Mar, Champaran Satyagrah and Indian National Army (INA).
The tracks will be developed by planting trees, herbs, shrubs and grasses in a way so as to depict the journey and sacrifices made by revolutionaries and freedom fighters.

Through Amrit Biodiversity Park, we aim to develop a landscape that ensures restoration of local ecology on the banks of river Yamuna. Only those plant species which are found in the catchment area of Yamuna will be used for plantation,"" said Barik.
In the biodiversity park, there will be five tracks on 90 hectares of land on the eastern bank which will depict the freedom struggle. The track on the theme of Dandi Mar will have plant sculptures which will show Mahatma Gandhi and people's participation in the freedom struggle, through live plant models.

As a part of the programme, the 28 ft statue of Netaji made from special black granite from Telangana will be unveiled beneath the canopy at India Gate, which once featured a statue of Bitish monarch King George V. That statue was removed and shifted in 1968 to Coronation Park at Burari in Delhi. Modi had unveiled the hologram statue of Netaji at the canopy on Jan 23.

It would also be an unique event as there would be no artificial backdrop behind the stage so that people can see both the India Gate and Netaji's statue during the event.
Sources said finishing touches are being given to all the works on the 3-km long Rajpath and its surrounding areas. They added special focus is on maintaining the lush green lawns"", which are expected to be popular with visitors.
Once the entire 2 km revamped stretch is opened for the public, visitors would also be allowed to walk through the India Gate arch since Amar Jawan Jyoti and the iconic inverted rifle and soldier's 'war helmet' have been moved from there to the National War Memorial. Sources admitted that managing the visitors and preventing them from walking on laws and entering water canals will be a tough task. The government is engaging an agency for housekeeping, cleaning and providing security guards for two years.

The lawns have been re-laid; canals have been revamped and 16 permanent bridges have been built over them. All utility services have been put underground.

Here are top things to know about today's key inauguration ...
Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 28-ft-tall statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate.
PM also inaugurated the newly-christened Kartavya Path -- a stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.
The ceremony was attended by 1,500 guests followed by a cultural event, including a drone show on Netaji's life.
PM also interacted with labourers who were engaged in the Central Vista Avenue revamp work.
The statue is part of the Centre's Rs 13,450-crore Central Vista project, which will have a new Parliament building.
The black granite statue has been carved from a monolithic block of granite weighing 280 metric tonne.
The block of granite picked for the statue was transported to Delhi from Telangana and the statue was carved out of it in over two months.
Meanwhile, the new 'Kartavya Path' stretch exhibits beautified landscapes, lawns with walkways, added green spaces, refurbished canals, new amenity blocks, improved signages and vending kiosks.
The entire stretch has been revamped under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.
According to the government, it symbolises a shift from erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment.
The government said the redevelopment is being done to address various concerns such as increasing traffic of visitors, lack of basic amenities (public toilets, drinking water, street furniture, parking space), inadequate signage, poor maintenance of water features and haphazard parking.
New pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting are some other features that will enhance the public experience.
Around 19 acres of total canal area have been revamped. They have been fitted with infrastructure such as aerators.
There are 16 bridges on the entire stretch. Boating will be allowed in two canals "" one near Krishi Bhawan and another around Vanijya Bhawan.
Along the Rajpath, the area spreading 3.90 lakh square metre has been developed with greenery all around. Also, the new red granite walkways spreading 15.5 km have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier.
The redevelopment project of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping the three-km Rajpath, a new prime minister's residence and office, and a new vice-president's enclave.

According to government sources, 320 trees were to be felled initially for the enclave, but the number came down to 154 after the intervention of SEIAA and SEAC. Similarly, the number of trees to be transplanted was reduced from 630 to 487. Several trees were to be removed for developing a surface parking"", but SEIAA and SEAC did not find it environment friendly, the sources said.
A similar intervention ensured that the user agency for the AIIMS redevelopment project would preserve 1,064 trees at their current locations while developing buildings around it. The site has 5,575 trees, out of which 2,934 are to be retained, 1,910 to be transplanted and 731 to be felled.
SEIAA last week granted the environmental clearance to the enclave, which will also have Cabinet Secretariat, India House and National Security Council Secretariat. It is part of the Central Vista project. In all, 487 trees will be transplanted. SEIAA had observed that shifting around 630 trees would mean removal of 60% of the trees and asked Central Public Works Department not to engage the transplantation agencies with a poor track record in ensuring survival of transplanted trees.

A total of 487 trees will be transplanted and the forest department in the last week of Aug also gave permission for the transplantation. However, SEIAA observed that the project will lead to a removal of 60% of the trees on the site and it asked the project proponent (PP) to ensure that the agencies, which have a poor track record in ensuring survival of trees, are not engaged for transplantation. SEIAA also referred to media reports on the poor survival rate of transplanted trees in Delhi.

Despite the work on this stretch having been more than 95% complete, it has not yet been opened to the public. The stretch has been closed to the public for 18 months now.

TOI has learnt that the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has been directed to wrap up the remaining works by the end of this month so that the stretch is ready for inauguration. Earlier, the housing ministry had announced different deadlines for completion of the project which have been missed.
Questions sent to the housing and urban affairs ministry, which is responsible for the project, on the progress and likely opening of the stretch, went unanswered. However, sources said all major works have been completed and minor civil works behind the lawns will be finished quickly. They said the area, which is visited by people, is almost ready and can be thrown open to the public.
The government has also set the target of installing the statue of Subhas Chandra Bose in the Grand Canopy at India Gate on Aug 15. Sources did not rule out the possibility of a grand event for opening of the revamped Central Vista Avenue along with the unveiling of Netaji's statue.
On any given day one can spot dozens of visitors and tourists negotiating with auto-rickshaw drivers at Central Secretariat Metro station to reach the India Gate area since Rajpath has been barricaded for the ongoing redevelopment works. A huge number of tourists gather at the crossing near the India Gate every evening, causing long traffic snarls and this has been a routine for the past several months.
It's very difficult to stop people from entering the lawns since we have started removing the barricades as we complete work. For us, the biggest challenge is to ensure that people use the public space properly. There are enough information signs urging people not to enter lawns, canals and walk only on the pathway,"" said an executive involved in the project.
Sources said once the stretch is opened for the public, the government may allow the tourists to walk through the India Gate arch as Amar Jawan Jyoti and the iconic inverted rifle and soldier's 'war helmet' have been moved from there to the National War Memorial.

The proposals were made by the DFS after the building designs were presented for approval and it had to fight resistance from the architects who said the changes will hamper the beauty of these buildings, they said.
The proposals include an internal road for fire tenders movement in case of high rise buildings and provisions for a fire check road for the protection of exits and staircases.
""Pressurisation"" of the staircase and means of escape is another recommendation suggested wherever required in the building designs, they said.
Each of the seven proposals consist of plans for more than two buildings which were cleared between 2020-2022, they said.
These buildings are -- New Parliament Building, New PMO building, Rajpath, Amenity block, and Common Central secretariat being made under the Central Vista project, and a few other office buildings.
Other than these, various in-built fire-fighting arrangements are recommended to be installed in the buildings such as a fire exit, a hose reel, a wet riser, hydrants, an automatic sprinkler system, internal hydrants and yard hydrants, pumping arrangements, and captive water storage for fire-fighting, the fire officers said.
""Automatic fire detection and alarming system, manual-operated electric fire alarm system and a public address system are also recommended as per National Building Code of India Chapter 4 on fire and fire safety.
""All the recommendations suggested are being followed and implemented in the building designs which had altered,"" the officer said.
Atul Garg, Director of DFS said, ""The buildings under the Central Vista project have state-of-the-art technology as far as the fire department is considered. We have tried to provide the best infrastructure for the fire safety system. This is going to have in-built fire safety systems with a set up of a huge fire control room as well.""
The fire officials said that initially it was not easy to convince the architects of the project to make certain specific changes in terms of fire safety system as they were of the view that any such changes could affect the beauty of the buildings.
""However, after a lot of discussions and at least seven-eight rounds of meetings held with our retired service providers, architects and consultants involved in the project, they agreed to make all the necessary suggestions recommended by the fire department to ensure an efficient fire safety system,"" the director told PTI.
He said the fire safety system provided in each of these buildings is ""one of the best of its kind.""
""As it is a very important project, the fire department has suggested more fire fighting systems. All due precautions have been taken with reference to the fire safety system of the buildings and it will be a model building as far as the fire system is considered even though there was stiff resistance earlier.""
Dr Sanjay Kumar Tomar, Deputy Chief Fire Officer said, the major recommendations suggested for each of these buildings include a fire safety arrangement, means of escape, and means of accessing and exiting the building with such considerations as the number, width, type and arrangement of sufficient number of exits.
Fire compartmentation, protection of exits through fire check doors, fire resistant material for construction of buildings as per unified by laws 2016 were also made to be incorporated in the design of the buildings, he said.
""Several meetings with the architects and designers were held and they were convinced and agreed to make the changes and submitted the revised building plans which were approved by Delhi Fire Service,"" Tomar said.
The officer said that ""It is usually a routine process that before giving approval to buildings, parameters with respect to fire and life safety measures are scrutinised and deficiencies, shortcomings are conveyed so that those shortcomings can be removed.""
Nowadays, all building plans are referred to Delhi Fire Service through the online portals of respective building sanctioning authorities such as Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Central Public Works Department, Public Work Department etc, he added.
According to the fire department, these building plans are either approved, and shortcomings if there are any are communicated online within 15 days of receipt of building plans.
In important projects of the government with fixed timeline, prior meetings are conducted to discuss fire safety measures according to their nature, such as if they are residential, educational, institutional (hospitals), business, mercantile, industrial, or are going to be used to store hazardous material.
Most of the buildings under the Central Vista project are divided into fire sub-compartments having fire resistant walls on all sides including top and bottom, which will help them contain fire within its origin, the fire officials said.
All openings (service ducts) in a fire compartment are sealed through fire resistant material. All exits are provided with fire check doors in a sub fire compartment, they said.
The buildings also have a smoke management system -- a very important provision to control smoke in case of fire, the fire officials said.
The buildings provide safe passage for the occupants and also facilitate fire-fighters to locate the origin of fire. This helps in controlling fire early leading to less damage.
""The fire smoke contains harmful gases like hydrogen snide, carbon monoxide and HCL. These affect in three ways... They are harmful poisonous gases, chemical irritants which impede escape by obscuring life,"" he added.",Delhi Fire Service shoehorns 7 safety measures in Central Vista buildings against resistance | Delhi News - Times of India,8,2022

As bhelpuri seller Kaushal Kumar said with exasperation: Earlier, we had more customers and more sales, therefore, bigger incomes. We could look after our families and even save money for the future. Now we manage to eke out a living and saving money is but a dream.""
After getting married at the age of 18 years, Chandarmukhi, now a grandmother of four, sold bottled water, cigarettes and cold drinks at the grassy locale. She said there was a significant difference"" in business in the pre-Central Vista days and now. I used to push a cart of water bottles, but now I have to lug this box of bottles around. We no longer have stalls here. Earlier, I easily took home around Rs 800 every day. Today, even earning half that amount is a huge achievement.""
Papad seller Narayan Shah, 38, narrated the same sad story of a sharp fall in income even as raw materials have become costlier. Paan seller Pradeep Kumar can no longer put up his stall. Instead, he walks around with a basket of paans, though all that effort yields little these days. From selling at least 25 paans daily at around Rs 20 apiece, my sales have come down to just around four a day,"" mumbled Kumar.
The once lively expanse now gets deserted after 8pm when the cops ask people to empty the area. Tourists, vendors and local visitors leave at the most lucrative time of the day. One seller said, If we could get permission to sell in front of India Gate, we could still hope to have a normal life. But people are now asking us to take up other jobs. Where can people like us find jobs? There's no help from the government or other agencies, so we continue trying to do what we have always done.""
Photographers, whose ubiquitous presence was part of the area's charms, now find that with police barricades, building debris and the tall construction-site metal barriers, hardly anyone wants to have their photos clicked. Roshan Lal gives it his best every day, even when there's limited space in which to ply his trade. Like others, he has raised the price of photographs to cope with loss of income. Lal, however, concedes, There are fewer photographers at India Gate now. So, there is less competition among us for customers.""
The hawkers are looking forward to the inauguration of the redeveloped Central Vista, though there is no official news about this yet. Visitors like Sonu Kumar, a 22-year-old Delhiite, too are optimistic. Moving Amar Jawan Jyoti from the site might have reduced the charm of this historic place,"" said Sonu. But I still hope that India Gate reverts to being the hotspot for relaxation it has always been.""",Vendors at India Gate rue loss of income | Delhi News - Times of India,7,2022

In a series of tweets, Yechury said, The Constitution unambiguously separates the 3 wings of our democracy  the Executive (government), the Legislature (Parliament and state assemblies) and the Judiciary.""

While talking to media persons, Trivedi said, The BJP government under the leadership of PM Modi is paving the way for development. But there are some people in this country who feel inconvenient until they get a chance to disturb the work. Congress is a party of the same disturbing attitude.""

It has been just 14 months since Chandni Chowk, redeveloped at a cost of Rs 99 crore, was inaugurated. Sadly, its proper maintenance wasn't given due attention, leading to this sorry situation.

Sisodia conducted a surprise inspection of Chandni Chowk on Jun 10 and said officials would be punished for misconduct in case of any laxity in the maintenance and cleanliness of the redeveloped 1.4km stretch, stretching from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid.
The condition of the stretch has deteriorated over a period of time due to the laxity of agencies. It was the first meeting after the chief nodal officer was appointed on the direction of the court.

The government had also released photographs of the revamped Rajpath and its lawns in Jan this year, barely days before the Republic Day celebrations. Sources admitted that the original deadline of less than one year for such a mammoth and complex project was too tough to meet. They said the second surge of Covid-19 and extended monsoon also contributed to the delay in project implementation.

Sources said they are confident of opening the entire three-km stretch of Rajpath to the public as soon as the ongoing works get completed next month. They said most of the works are nearing completion including underpasses at the Janpath-Rajpath crossing and C-Hexagon. These are being built to create safe passage for tourists without causing any hindrance to the traffic.

The underground APM system, which will have a total length of 3.1 km, will run in a closed loop and primarily meet transportation needs of government employees working in these buildings. The corridor will connect four common Central Secretariat buildings and will have an underground yard as well.
The system will be connected to the existing Metro network through an interchange station at Central Secretariat, which will provide integration with the Yellow (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre) and Violet (Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh) Lines. A major aim behind the project is to reduce the need to commute to office using private vehicles.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which is preparing a detailed project report (DPR), has started the process for engaging a detailed design consultant for civil, architectural, and building services for the project.
The consultant, however, will also assist in finalising technical specifications of various systems, and design of trainway and stations. The capacity of the system and frequency of trains will be based on the expected peak hour demand of 20,000 passengers per hour during the morning and evening peak hours, according to the tender floated by DMRC.
The consultant will make presentations to DMRC and other stakeholders and submit a detailed report that will also examine the option of using trainsets already being used in Delhi Metro network. As per the document, the trains will have a three-coach configuration and the system will have a standard gauge, like all comparatively new Delhi Metro corridors. The trains will have to be wide enough to accommodate 764 to 970 passengers during peak hour conditions.
Train movement will be managed from an operation control centre (OCC) and grade of automation of the trains is likely to be at par with the new corridors of Delhi Metro.
A series of intensive workshops will also be held with all stakeholders to finalise the system parameters and technological specifications. These workshops will include discussions on the automation level to be adopted for operation of Central Vista line from GoA2, GoA3 or GoA4, apart from what type of evacuation to be adopted  from side or front of train. At GoA2 mode, the train is only started manually by the driver and from there on, it is taken over by the OCC, which controls everything from speed of train to stopping and opening of doors.

The foundation for the building was laid on Jun 22, 2018. But it was delayed due to several reasons, including the Covid-19 pandemic.
The building has come up on a plot of approximately 4.4 acres and has been designed according to the architecture of Lutyens' Delhi, using materials such as Dholpur and Agra sandstones. Grand stone columns like the ones in Rashtrapati Bhavan have also been used in this building.

PIL petitioner and advocate Ardhendumauli Kumar Prasad told a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose that Parliament has periodically increased the sanctioned strength of SC judges, from six in 1950 to 34 in 2019, given the exponential rise in the number of cases filed annually before the SC, from a little over 1,000 in 1950s to over a lakh in 2020.
There has also been a massive increase in the number of advocates practicing in the SC as also the number of litigants visiting the highest court, he said and lamented that the infrastructure that was created in 1950s has seen miserly expansion over the decades to severely inconvenience the judges, lawyers, court staff and litigants.
The bench issued notices to the Supreme Court, through its secretary general, and to the Union ministries of law and justice and housing and urban affairs, asking the respondents to file their responses by Mar 30, the next date of hearing on the PIL.
Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, in his various speeches in the last six months and in the presence of law minister, has complained about inadequate infrastructure for judiciary and has submitted a concrete proposal to the Union government for creation of National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to expeditiously meet the infrastructure requirement of judiciary, especially the trial courts. But, there has not been any positive response to the proposal, even though the law minister had agreed to consider it expeditiously.
Prasad in his petition said that though the trial courts and tribunals, as the frontline judicial forums, bear the brunt of litigation but continue to groan under pressure of pendency and inadequate infrastructure. He said though there are 24,291 judicial officers, there are only 20,115 courtrooms and 17,705 residential units.
The PIL sought a direction to the Centre to prepare a layout and execute construction work of 'Judicial Vista' on the land adjoining the Supreme Court to provide dignified working space and condition to Judges, court staff and lawyers and better facilities to visiting litigants.
It also sought a direction to the Union government to constitute an independent central authority for creation of judicial infrastructure for High Courts, trial court and tribunals with expenditure from the Consolidated Fund for India.","Why not a 'Judicial Vista' on lines of Central Vista, asks SC | India News - Times of India",3,2022

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said for writing history, one does not have to wipe out old history.
""The previous governments created history by building the foundations of education, health and social justice in the country. It is a different matter that Modiji thinks he can write history by constructing buildings and beautifying those.
""History can never be written by buildings, lime and mortar but by the work one does,"" she told reporters here.
The Congress leader said Modi is getting the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project constructed, which houses his residence, adding that he could have provided some space for his predecessors in the project.
""Modiji has been trying to make history from the day he came to power in May 2014. But India has a very rich history of its culture and society.
""For writing history, one does not have to wipe out old history. We would have been happy had the prime minister provided some space for our former prime ministers in the grand Central Vista project. I want to ask him if he could provide some space in the grand project for our former prime ministers, but is there space for them in his heart?"" she asked.
Every government formed after the independence has contributed in taking India to the heights it has achieved today, Modi said on Thursday and asserted that barring one or two exceptions, the country has a proud tradition of strengthening democracy in a democratic manner.
In his speech after inaugurating the ""Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya"" (prime ministers' museum), which is dedicated to all the 14 former prime ministers, Modi said all of them contributed immensely in the fulfilment of the goals of constitutional democracy.
Modi also bought the first ticket of the museum before its inauguration, officials said.
The prime minister said it is the responsibility of everyone to strengthen democracy, noting that India has a proud tradition of doing so in a democratic manner, barring one or two exceptions.
Though he did not elaborate, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been critical of the previous Congress governments, especially the one headed by Indira Gandhi, for allegedly weakening democracy.

A source said the barrier wall controls air currents and prevents erosion by obstructing the wind near the ground and stops the soil from blowing off-site. Eight anti-smog guns have been installed at vantage points, which spray fine droplets of water over the site. This not only helps dust particles settle down, but also wets the ground to avoid creation of any further dust due to digging and other construction activities.
Four water tankers have been provided for periodic sprinkling of water so that dust levels are within limits despite heavy vehicular movement. Care is also being taken to limit dust pollution from stone cutting and grinding works. The stone slabs are made wet before cutting or grinding to control dust generation. In addition, cutting machine enclosures have been made to limit the area of this activity. Water jet machines are used for cutting stone.
An automatic wheel washing facility has been made at the exit gate and more will be installed in the weeks to come. The wheels of trucks and other vehicles leaving the site are cleaned to prevent mud, slurry and other pollutants from ending up on roads. Excavated earth is properly covered before being transported. Heaps of excavated earth are stacked with agricultural nets to prevent dust from rising in the air.
To maintain air quality, the company is carrying out ambient air monitoring through an NABL-accredited agency. Pocket monitoring meters are being used for daily checks. Reviews are conducted periodically and improvisation done based on feedback from stakeholders.",Central Vista: Work on with pollution guards | Delhi News - Times of India,11,2021

NDMC member Kuljeet Singh Chahal said the project, which was cleared in a meeting on Wednesday, aims to give an aesthetic look to these roads, similar to the Central Vista design. It will cost over Rs 7 crore.
From sculptures to gardening on roadsides and central verges to developing footpaths, railings and even signage, everything will be developed in a similar manner and continuing the same design,"" Chahal said, adding NDMC might take help from artists and experts before going ahead with the project. The project, once implemented, will give the NDMC area an all-new look.""
He added that eventually all stretches would be covered, especially the one connecting Mandi House to India Gate. To make the place look more attractive, we have plans to develop waste-to-wealth parks in our area soon,"" said Chahal.

Inaugurating the new state-of-the-art building constructed at Technology Bhavan campus for the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in New Delhi, Singh said ""de-silosation"" not only of work but also workplaces is needed for better and cost-effective outcomes.
Referring to the prime minister's vision of the Central Vista project, Singh said, even after 74 years of independence, the nation does not have a central secretariat and various ministries have hired premises and thousands of crore of rupees is paid as rent for the same, according to a statement by the ministry of science and technology.
He said this project will not only save money, but will also bring better cohesion in administration and output.
The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the power corridor of the country -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat, the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.
Recalling that the buildings occupied by the DST were originally constructed as warehouses used for storage of foodgrains imported by USAID under ""Public Law-480"", Singh said that the new building complex symbolises the Mar of India from the state of deficiency to self-sufficiency under the present regime, as the country has not only become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in foodgrain production but also has emerged as one of the leading exporting countries.
""We had eminent scientists and towering personalities in the decades of 60s and 70s, but they lacked the world-class facilities being created now,"" he said.

Patel said that to complete the project on a war footing, only the structure is being built onsite while rest of the work including interiors and furniture design is being completed at different locations across the country which would be assembled on the site.

This was the first time that Patel, who hails from Ahmedabad and is president of the prestigious CEPT University, shared intimate details about one of the most ambitious projects in New Delhi with the architecture students and practitioners at the Cept campus on Friday.

The structures on the (Raisina) hill were symbols of the Raj  sitting on the hill and looking down on the landscape What's now happening is, the government is going into the buildings there (in the vista), and the building on the hill (North and South Block) is becoming the cultural facility of people of India,"" he said.
During his presentation, Patel said that compared to the 552 seats in Lok Sabha, the new design accommodates 676 in the current phase, which would be expanded up to 772 keeping in mind the need for expansion in the future. He said that the existing colour scheme of houses  green for Lok Sabha and red for Rajya Sabha  is integrated in the new design with iconography of two national symbols  Peacock for Lok Sabha and Lotus for Rajya Sabha.
He said that the design of the vista and especially the government buildings has integrated several elements of Indian architecture.
During the discussion with students and architects at the event, Patel said that project has remained under public scrutiny from the start. ""The criticism of the project primarily stemmed from the society's reluctance to change. As professionals, we need to ask ourselves this question  this knee-jerk reaction, which says no change in the name of heritage, environment, everything This will be disastrous for us,"" he said.

She also raised the issue of suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha MPs, terming the move as ""outrageous"", and said it is unprecedented that they have been suspended for the remaining period of the Winter Session.

Congress MPs of both houses of Parliament and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi were present during the meeting in the central hall of Parliament.
The Congress president said it was extraordinary that Parliament has not been given an opportunity so far to have a discussion on the challenges the country continues to face on its borders.
""Such a discussion would have also been an opportunity to demonstrate a collective will and resolve. The government may not want to answer difficult questions but it is the right and duty of the opposition to seek clarifications and explanations.
""The Modi government steadfastly refuses to allocate time for a debate. I would once again urge for a full-fledged discussion on the border situation and relations with our neighbours,"" Gandhi told the meeting.
The Congress chief said the government has finally repealed the three farm laws, even it was done ""undemocratically just as their passage last year was pushed through without discussion"".
She said it is the solidarity and tenacity of the farmers, their discipline and dedication that has forced an ""arrogant government to climbdown"".
Saluting the farmers for their achievement, Gandhi remembered the sacrifice of over 700 farmers in the past 12 months and called for honouring their sacrifice.
""We are firm in our commitment to stand by the farmers in their demands for a legally guaranteed MSP, remunerative prices that meet the costs of cultivation, and compensation to the bereaved families,"" she said.

She also accused the Modi government of selling off precious national assets like banks, insurance companies, public sector enterprises, railways and airports.
""First, the prime minister destroyed the economy with his demonetisation move of Nov 2016. He is continuing on that disastrous path, but calling it monetisation. Now, he is dismantling the public sector built up over the past seventy years with strategic, economic and social objectives in mind,"" she said.
Hitting out at the government for claiming economic recovery, Gandhi said, ""Recovery for whom is the real question? It means nothing to those millions who have lost their livelihoods, and to those MSMEs whose businesses have been crippled not just by the Covid-19 pandemic but also by the combined effects of 'notebandi' and the hasty implementation of a flawed GST.""
She said a few big companies making profits or the stock market rising to new heights does not mean that the economy is recovering. ""And if profits are being made by shedding labour, what social value do these profits have,"" she asked.
On the Covid situation, she said, the sad reality is that the country is nowhere close to reaching the level of double-dose vaccination announced by the Government for the end of the year.
Efforts must clearly be intensified and the daily vaccination dose has to increase four-fold so that 60 per cent of the population is covered with both doses, she said, hoping the Government has learnt a lesson from the previous waves of Covid and is preparing itself to dealing effectively with the new variant.
""There are many other issues that we want to raise. Important amongst them, are a discussion on the various challenges confronting Indian agriculture and the urgent need to have direct income support to families who have lost their livelihoods. We must insist on it,"" she said.

Appearing for 'Developers and Builders Forum', a body of more than 60 reputed builders in Delhi who claimed to use the latest construction technology for reducing dust pollution as per laid down norms, Singh sought urgent listing of the application seeking lifting of the ban on all construction activities, except non-polluting activities relating to construction such as the plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry.
In contrast, Singh had appeared for petitioner Aditya Dubey and argued on Nov 29 before a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana that while the construction work at small projects are stopped to the the detriment of construction workers for the sake of right to life, which included right to clean air and environment, of residents of Delhi and NCR, ""the construction of massive Central Vista Project is being carried on at full swing right under the nose of the Supreme Court. Is Central Vista work more important than the lives of crores of residents of Delhi and NCR?""
The SC had sought response from the Centre on the measures taken to control dust pollution from the Central Vista project, but had asked the petitioner not to stay focussed on one project and derail the court's endeavour to address the larger issue of air pollution from all sources and devising means to control it round the year.
On Monday, when Singh sought listing of the builders' application, CJI Ramana said, ""On one side, you appear for petitioner and want the pollution to stop. On the other side, you appear for the builders and want construction activities to go on. Let the government take a call on this issue.""
Singh said that the government had passed an order banning construction activities on the basis of the orders passed by the apex court and that the industry is losing hundreds of crores daily. But, the SC refused to accede to Singhs demand for an urgent listing of the builders' plea.
The builders' forum was seeking modification of the SC's Nov 24 order, which said In the meantime, as an interim measure and until further orders, we re-impose the ban on the construction activities in the NCR subject to the following two conditions: (i) Non-polluting activities relating to construction such as the plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry are allowed to be continued; (ii) The States shall use the funds which have been collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers to provide them subsistence for the period during which construction activities are prohibited and pay wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act for the respective categories of workers.""",Can't appear for anti-pollution steps and builders: SC to lawyer | India News - Times of India,12,2021

The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan here.
The main Cental Vista project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the Prime Minister and the vice president.
It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries offices.
The high court had dismissed the plea saying it was ""motivated"" and filed with ""ill-intent"" and ""lack of bona fides"".
The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted the work to be halted in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, observing that it was ""not a genuine public interest litigation"".
Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav Wednesday filed the petition in the apex court challenging the high court verdict.
Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was not justified"" in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence"".
It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a serious public health issue"" concern.
It said the high court was not justified in holding that the construction activities for the project is essential activities, especially when the entire activities of service sector, industrial sector and the activities of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are fully suspended during the peak pandemic lockdown period"".

Right at the beginning of the hearing, petitioner Aditya Dubey's counsel Vikas Singh said while construction work at small projects are stopped to the detriment of the labourers for the sake of right to life, which includes right to clean air and environment, of the residents of Delhi and the NCR, ""the construction of the massive Central Vista is being carried on at full swing right under the nose of the Supreme Court. Is Central Vista work more important than the lives of crores of residents of Delhi and NCR?""
A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant asked the Centre and Delhi government to explain the construction works being carried out in their respective jurisdictions within Delhi and whether statutory anti-dust pollution measures have been put in place. The SC, however, asked the petitioner not to stay focussed on one project and derail the endeavour of the court to address the larger issue of air pollution and means to control it round the year. ""We are asking Mehta to explain,"" the CJI said.
The Centre in its affidavit said Delhi government needed to take proactive steps to control pollution from vehicular emissions. Mehta said, ""As per the direction of the Supreme Court, the public transport fleet within National Capital Territory(NCT) was required to be augmented to approximately 11,000 CNG buses. However, the fleet of around 6,000 buses in 2010 have now depleted to nearly 3,000 buses. Thus urgent steps are required to be taken to augment bus fleet by the Delhi government.""
Justice Chandrachud flagged this as an important issue but senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Delhi government, said special CNG buses have been provided in the last three four days to carry from people from 12-14 points in Delhi to Delhi secretariat. But, Justice Chandrachud interrupted Singhvi to ask why the number of buses has come down from 6,000 to 3,000 when it should have been increased to 11,000.
Singhvi said, ""This is alarmingly false (the statement in Centre's affidavit about strength of bus fleet in Delhi).""
The SC asked Delhi government to file an affidavit by Thursday regarding the available number of buses in Delhi for public transport. ""Take steps to comply with the directions,"" the bench said. Singhvi said, ""As far as the NCT is concerned 90% of the directions are complied with or are being complied with. Four days ago, the SC asked the states to pay construction workers from the welfare fund, built from the cess collected from builders. The Delhi government decided to pay Rs 5,000 to every eligible construction worker, which number around 2.95 lakh in Delhi. An amount of 147 core has been disbursed.""

Launching the GIS-based initiative that brings 16 infrastructure-related central departments on the same platform, the PM said the previous approach to development, marred by wasteful expenditure, amounted to an insult"" of taxpayers' money. There was a view that nothing will change, things will be like this only,"" he said.
He took a swipe at the opposition and critics, saying that some sections have made it a fashion to criticise infrastructure that the country should be proud of, a possible reference to criticism of projects like the Central Vista Redevelopment by a section of political opinion and commentators. Better planning can crucially cut logistical costs and make Indian businesses more competitive. He urged the states to join the initiative and said private businesses will also benefit from the new system.

Spelling out several measures taken by his government since 2014, Modi said the big step-up in the spread of optical fibre networks, doubling and electrification of railways, increase in the number of food parks , ambitious plans to reduce turnaround time at ports and making India a big MRO hub for aviation spoke for themselves.
Explaining the change in mindset and processes Gati Shakti involves, the PM said the aim of a tech-based platform that provides detailed ground-level information was to ensure elimination of duplication and incomplete planning and execution. The common scenario of industrial parks coming up without adequate thought to connectivity or roads and railway lines not being coordinated can be avoided. Every department plans for itself. They need to think collectively,"" he said.
Fixing something that had gone bad takes a lot of effort and the gap between macro-planning and micro-execution is huge, Modi said.

Vista project is both a matter of pride and necessity. It won't hit Covid work
The overnight transformation of Nehru-Gandhi parivar bhakts into Lutyens' bhakts is quite intriguing. Their opposition to the Central Vista Project on the facile grounds that many 'heritage' buildings in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone (LBZ) are being destroyed is totally misplaced.
The Lutyens' Bungalow Zone that houses government offices including Rashtrapati Bhavan was developed by Edward Lutyens over a decade in 1921-31.
Lutyens, a lesser-known architect in London, became famous in India because of the opportunity to build a few important structures like the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, India Gate and North and South Blocks in Delhi. Contrary to the Opposition's propaganda, none of these heritage structures is being demolished under the Central Vista project.
Historical records suggest that all other buildings in the LBZ were built with a paucity of time and resources and do not carry any real heritage value. Renowned hotelier and architectural restorer Aman Nath described the buildings in LBZ as a design compromise"" to overcome a diminished budget and yet cover the maximum land area.""
Incidentally, it was during the UPA 2 government in 2012 that the proposal for constructing a new Parliament House was envisaged initially.
Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar had recommended constituting a high-powered committee to suggest an alternative complex for the Parliament citing increased footfall, insufficient space and challenges of structural stability as the reasons.
Those concerns were genuine. The present Parliament was built in 1921-27 to host the Imperial Legislative Council and Central Legislative Assembly during British rule.
The Constituent Assembly had held its meetings in it during 1946-49. The building has been serving as the Parliament House since 1950, housing both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. India's population and political activity have grown manifold in the last seven decades. After the delimitation in 2026, a substantial increase in the strength of both Houses is also anticipated. The present structure will thus be insufficient to cater to the growing needs of the Indian democracy.
The other bungalows in the LBZ have also become grossly inadequate for the functioning of government ministries. Successive regimes, including those of the Congress, had to make many structural modifications to them prompting the London-based Lutyens' Trust to rush to Delhi in 2008 to discuss their preservation. Currently, 39 out of 51 ministries are partly or fully housed in the LBZ area. Many ministries have rented office spaces outside the area incurring annual expenditure of over Rs 1,000 crore.
These factors led PM Modi to set the ball in motion for the construction of the Central Vista project in 2019. It involves construction of a new People's Parliament, a Central Vista from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, a new complex for the Vice President and a new house for the PM.
First part of the five-year project, which includes a new Parliament building and the new Central Vista, is expected to be completed by 2022 when India celebrates 75 years of its independence. It will naturally be a matter of pride for every Indian.
The government has put criticism to rest by assuring that all the significant heritage and cultural artefacts, presently housed at the National Museum, National Archives and Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), will be carefully preserved. The National Museum will be relocated to the North and South Blocks, and is expected to have 3.5 times more space ""from the current 25,500 sqm to approximately 80,000 sqm.
The entire Central Vista project is expected to be completed by 2024. Necessary budgetary allocation for the project cost of about Rs 13,500 crore has been made in 2019 itself. That brings annual expenditure to just around Rs 2,700 crore. No additional spending is happening beyond the previously sanctioned budget. Covid relief activity is not getting hampered in any way.
The government has already allocated over Rs 35,000 crore for the vaccination drive in the country. Construction projects have been exempted from Covid restrictions in all states. In fact, many major infrastructure projects have been in progress in the country. The cash-starved Maharashtra government has issued tenders for a 900-crore redevelopment of the MLA hostel at Nariman Point in Mumbai recently.
The Chhattisgarh government stalled construction work of the new Raj Bhavan, Assembly and CM House only after BJP president J P Nadda pointed out the duplicity of the Congress few days ago.
Congress' opposition to the project appears more about legacy than about the pandemic. Having named hundreds of institutions after one family, they seem worried that the Nehru-Gandhi legacy of institution-building was being usurped by Modi's men. They are ridiculing the new PM House as 'Modi ka ghar'. But it was they who slyly converted the actual PM House at Teen Murti into the Nehru Memorial Museum after Jawaharlal Nehru's demise in 1964.
The new Central Vista is not going to be the legacy of any individual or party. It is the need of the hour and a matter of pride for an Atma Nirbhar nation.

The staging ground of our democracy is being bulldozed without debate
The Central Vista Redevelopment Project, since mid-2019, has been a race between a nimble hare clearing the fences of 'permissions', and a motley group of tortoises.
Even as the tortoises carefully listed the faults in the selection process, the hare had skipped away to the bhoomi puja for the new Parliament building.
As the tortoises got down to scrutinising this new proposal, the hare nibbled the grass on the Rajpath lawns and put up a board reading government land"". While the tortoises were dismayed at the prospect of the National Museum being relocated, the hare was giving brisk orders to the staff of IGNCA to parcel their documents and move to Janpath Hotel.
When the tortoises reached the Vista, they found stern notices prohibiting entry. When the smallest tortoise started to write down the details that puzzled her, the hare looked over the barricade and mocked her: But I told you the plan would be an evolving one!""
The bulldozers, physical and verbal, grind slowly, and they grind exceeding fine. There have been no debates.
There have been questions and criticism. These are sometimes answered, sometimes not.
Here are some questions for the hare in a hurry:
In 2019, didn't the ministry promise a website for the project? Where is it? Axonometric drawings and models to scale are needed to get a sense of relative distances and heights. So far, all we have been shown is a sketch of brown rectangles on a green ground. The number of blocks and their positions kept changing over the months (the plan, in the architect's signature phrase, keeps 'evolving').
This week, his firm's website uploaded a plan showing five towers north of Rajpath, with four towers and a convention centre on the south. Is that final or is it still evolving?
Even in 1912-13, there were lively debates about design, style, locations. This time, government officials "" who are doing most of the speaking "" tell us that the ensemble will be representative of the 'New India', that it is 'state-of-the-art' and 'world-class'. Today's state-of-the-art, we all know, is tomorrow's obsolescent. As to 'world-class' "" which world?
There is a complete lack of clarity on heritage "" its content, its relevance. It doesn't help that heritage has become the prerogative of the Ministry of Urban Development, the DDA and the CPWD. The Ministry
of Culture, the ASI and INTACH have been silent.
In 1985, the citizens of Delhi viewed and discussed the models submitted by competitors for the IGNCA project. Why has there been no public conversation around the current project ?
We, the people of India, are now forbidden entry to the Central Vista. We lost all 80-plus acres of our public space in March 2020 in violation of the 2021 master plan of Delhi. The officials who concocted the plan and the by-laws are impassive when they are bypassed. The CPWD both submits and approves plans ( I'll be judge I'll be jury/ said cunning old Fury"").
Much work is going on below the surface "" the moles helping the hare "" to lay out a tunnel for the Prime Minister to move from his new home to the new Parliament House.
It is argued that performance will be improved by consolidation, by herding central government employees
scattered elsewhere into nine towers. I wonder who thought that one up, when the country is being catapulted into digital connectivity?
Does the humongous allocation for new buildings include that of demolishing 4,60,000 sqm of structures, that of transit accommodation for officials in Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue, or the interior of Janpath Hotel, repurposed for IGNCA?
Whoever suffers losses in this annus horribilis, it certainly will not be contractors and builders.
News reports announce in a matter-of-fact way that 'three iconic buildings' are to be demolished "" the IGNCA, the National Archives Annexe, and the National Museum. These are not just bricks and mortar, they have been venues for the meeting of minds: will people remember Dr Sivaramamurti, Dr Sourin Roy, and Dr Kapila Vatsyayan? They were built up by the work of dozens of anonymous curators.
The IGNCA was warned about its fate some months ahead, but the Museum was given notice only a few days ago; it takes months to prepare inventories, to pack with care, to plan new homes in North and South Blocks.
Apparently one is to house objects and documents till 1857, while the other will focus on the two centuries after 1857. Which art historian in his/her right mind suggested that?
A sub-project of 'beautification' is being carried out on the verges along Rajpath for Republic Day 2022. Perhaps they will set up barricades to hide the ruins on either side, as has been done in the past to hide our urban poor.
Celebrate Republic Day? The War Memorial Arch, which we call India Gate, honours the war dead. For January 26, 2022 we need another memorial, another moment of silence "" for those we have lost in the pandemic, who will never see the triumphal parade on the 'beautified' avenue.
As for those who remain "" will they be allowed to eat ice cream at India Gate again?

Both these projects are being executed as part of the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.
Stressing upon the need of a new Parliament building, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that the current one is ""unsafe"" as when it had been constructed, it was in Seismic Zone II, but now that area lies in Seismic Zone IV.
During an interaction at the 'India Today Conclave 2021', Puri said that the existing building, which doesn't have the capacity to accommodate more parliamentarians, was never designed to be Parliament and it was a council house of a colonial power.
""The number of members (parliamentarians) has been increasing since we became an Independent country. So, there have been a lot of internal adjustments and new facilities have been added...from a purely structural point of view, it is an unsafe building.
""When the building was constructed, it was in Seismic Zone II and today, that area is in Seismic Zone IV. It is not an exaggeration. We don't want to create panic, but you know you are above pushing the limit ..."" he said.
The redevelopment of the Central Vista envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, a new Prime Minister's residence and office, and a new Vice President's Enclave.
Tata Projects Limited has been constructing a new Parliament building near the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.
The government said that the winter session of Parliament in Dec next year will be held in the new building.
Shapoorji Pallonji and Co Pvt Ltd has been executing the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. The government plans to hold the Republic Day parade on the revamped Rajpath next year.
""These two segments are actually the showcase segment (of the Central Vista redevelopment project),"" he said, adding that these two projects will be completed within the time period.
Besides, the government had floated tenders for the construction of three new buildings of Common Central Secretariat on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located
Last month, four infrastructure firms "" Tata Projects Limited, Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd, L&T Construction and NCC Ltd "" had submitted technical bids for the project.","Old Parliament 'unsafe'; new building, Central Vista Avenue to be completed on time: Puri | India News - Times of India",10,2021

Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the land occupied by the two buildings account for one-fifth of the area on which the hutments and barracks were built. He said it was unacceptable that defence personnel dealing had to work from barracks and hutments which the Britishers built factoring in their need to have stables for their horses.
Modi said soon after taking charge of the prime ministership in 2014, he felt the need for better facilities for MPs in Parliament and to improve government offices.

Why was Central Vista construction opposed
In the joint plea by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, the petitioners had contended that the project was not an essential activity and can be put on hold for time being.
During the May 17 hearing, the Centre had termed the plea as a ""facade"" or a ""disguise"", aimed at stalling the project.
The petitioners on the other hand had contended they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area.
The petitioners' counsel had likened the project to ""Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II. The petitioners' counsel Sidharth Luthra had contended that the Centre's claim on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre and other amenities on the site were all false.

The work of the Defence Office Complexes which was to be completed in 24 months has been completed in a record time of just 12 months, he pointed out and added that this was done when all challenges were to the fore in the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hundreds of workers got employment in this project during the pandemic, he noted.
The PM credited this to a new thinking and approach in the government's functioning.
""When policies and intentions are clear, will power is strong and efforts honest, everything is possible,"" he said.
Modi said these defence office complexes are constructed in 13 acre land parcels unlike earlier times when five times more land was used for similar complexes.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the defence office complexes were in line with the prime minister's vision for 'New India' and his commitment to the Central Vista project.

Central Vista project threatening lives: Plea
A bench of justices DN Patel and Jasmeet Singh on Monday asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra to file an application and said they would take it up on Tuesday.

The plea challenges the ongoing construction activity on the part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project designated as 'Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project' during the pandemic, arguing that Centre and CPWD's relentless, unmindful and reckless act of carrying on this project in a manner poses a threat to the lives of the citizens of Delhi and beyond, including the lives of the workforce/labour engaged in the project and has the potential of being a super spreader.

Transplantation, however, is yet to begin after the section was recently discovered to be a 'deemed' forest under the Delhi forest and wildlife department.
A deemed forest is an expanse with more than 250 trees growing per hectare. With the categorisation of the IGNCA plot as such, permission now has to be obtained under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to transplant or fell trees. Forest officials in Delhi said such a permission can only be availed of from the central government. The Central Public Works Department will need to send a fresh project proposal to be able to transplant the displaced trees.
A forest official revealed that transplantation was yet to begin on the site despite a list prepared for the shifting of 1,838 trees. While it is easier to get permission to prune, fell or transplant a tree under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, the process is stricter when it relates to a forest. CPWD had submitted a list of trees to be transplanted, complete with their height and details of the species. That work is yet to commence because an inspection of the site later qualified it as a deemed forest area,"" the official explained.
Navneet Srivastava, deputy conservator of forest (West), under whose jurisdiction the IGNCA site falls, confirmed the development. Upon checking, we found the site met the criteria for a deemed forest and informed CPWD. Fresh permission will have to be sought under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and felling or transplanting trees under that law is not as easy,"" said Srivastava.
The forest department said that the new request had to be sent to the central government, with the Delhi department required to pass on the project details once CPWD reapplied for permission. We have received the fresh request and a proposal will now be submitted to the Centre,"" said an official.
The project details show that 1,838 trees of 60 species are to be relocated. The most abundant species at the site were Gular (172), Shahtoot (114) and Pipal and Ashok (112 each).
Eco activist Bhavreen Kandhari said she wrote a letter to the DCF (West) requesting an inspection of the site to ascertain where it was a deemed forest or a part of the morphological Ridge area. If it is indeed a deemed forest, then it is strange how the permissions to transplant were given in the first place.

Opposing the Centre's stand before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the petitioners termed the project a central fortress of death"" and dubbed that it might turn into an Auschwitz"" in the gardens of Delhi"" triggering a strong condemnation from the solicitor general, Tushar Mehta.
On its part, the Centre alleged that the PIL was a facade"" and a second shot"" to somehow stall the project, which was not to the liking of the petitioners, even after the Supreme Court had cleared it.
Starting the arguments, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, accused the Centre of shooting the messenger"" instead of taking note of the petitioners' message of health, life and safety for the people of Delhi, including the workers and police staff at the construction site.
Luthra said it was no longer the Central Vista, but the central fortress of death"", and compared it to the Auschwitz"", as workers and others exposed to the infection might pass it on to their families. He contended that the Centre's submissions on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre, among others, on the site were all false, or had been put in place after the PIL was filed.
The lawyer alleged that empty tents were set up and there was no bed or bedding for the workers to stay or sleep in the first week of May. Luthra added that, while the Centre claimed that some workers stayed back willingly to work on the project, no proof of their willingness was shown.
Opposing the claims, the SG said one of the petitioners had long been venomously"" opposed to the project long before it got the go ahead from the Supreme Court and had even written several articles. The petitioners are not concerned for the health and safety of workers at the other constructions going on in the city. Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) regarding the health of the workers,"" he added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.
Construction firm Shapoorji Pallonji, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the PIL, saying it lacked bona fide. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the firm, told the court that there was no law under which he had to place on record a worker's willingness to work. He also questioned the locus of the petitioners to question the deadlines fixed for completing the project, underlining that the company had to finish it by Nov so that the Republic Day parade could be held in Rajpath.
He added that half of Rajpath had been dug up, and if the work was stalled, then, when the monsoon would come, the pits would fill up with water, which could lead to collapse of the adjacent areas, and become a breeding ground for dengue and other vector-borne diseases.

The Central Public Works Department has invited bids according to which the agency concerned will have to transplant trees in 60 days and 365 days will be for the maintenance of the transplanted trees.
The CPWD said the entire project will be executed at an estimated cost of around Rs 1.86 crore.
Last month, the CPWD had invited bids for three new office buildings under the Common Central Secretariat along Rajpath at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore and Rs 139 crore was set aside for five year's maintenance.
These three new buildings will come on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located.
According to the bids for the transplantation of trees, there are 2,219 trees (approximately) on plot number 137, out of which 1,838 trees (approximately) are to be transplanted.
There are 1,150 trees having girth up to 50 cm, which will be transplanted, the bids stated, adding that there are also 401 trees which have girth beyond 50 cm and up to 90 cm.
In bid documents, the CPWD said it is proposed to avoid cutting of trees to the maximum extent and instead transplant the affected trees, within the site or in the vicinity, in a phased manner.
The girth and height of the tree will be measured and recorded before the start of any activity, the CPWD said, adding that photographs of each tree before the start of the process of translocation will be submitted by the bidder. The tree will be geo-tagged before and after transplantation.
""Lifting of trees shall be carried out or supervised by a qualified and/or suitably experienced person and crane operator using a crane and supports. It shall be ensured that there is no damage to the soil ball or any scratching and splitting of the root system. The tree should be kept intact without injuries to its root system, trunk and crown,"" it stated.
The entire process of translocation will be video graphed and submitted fortnightly to the CPWD. Penalty of Rs 5,000 will be imposed if the agency fails to do so.
The agency will carry out a social audit and get certified ""survival assessment report"" at the end of each maintenance sub-period (quarterly) to ascertain survival rate.
The redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3 km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new prime minister''s residence and prime minister''s office, and a new vice president enclave.","Central Vista: CPWD to transplant 1,838 trees for construction of three new buildings | India News - Times of India",5,2021

He also raised the issue of inflation and rising fuel prices.
While addressing the media at state Congress headquarters, Anwar said there was a huge difference in the death figures given by various agencies, foreign media and the Union government. A foreign media stated that 42 lakh died. Some say it was ten times more than what the government's figures. Still, the central government has not come up with any explanation to satisfy the common people,"" he said and repeated the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi's demand for a white paper on the issue.
He also criticized the Centre for submitting an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating reasons for not being able to pay Rs4 lakh compensation to the families of Covid victims. For them, the Central Vista project worth Rs20,000 crore is more important than spending Rs16,000 crore to help to the families of Covid victims,"" Anwar said.
He also raised the issue of high petrol, diesel, edible oil and cooking gas prices, saying common man was facing the brunt of inflation in the country. He mocked the BJP leaders for protesting during Congress's regime and now remaining quiet over the issue. But now when the crude oil price is lower in international market, the price of petrol and diesel is being increased in India daily. Our economy is in bad shape and GDP is even lower than smaller neigbouring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka,"" he said.

However, state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel hit back at Anwar saying the NDA government was focusing on controlling the Covid-19 and vaccinating the maximum number of people. Let them count the number of infection and deaths, our prime focus is to get people vaccinated and we have targeted to vaccinate at least 70 to 80% of the beneficiaries across the country in the next six months,"" said Patel.
He further said the NDA government was also working on producing an alternative to petrol and diesel so that import of crude oil is reduced. Patel cited the increase in the prices of crude oil in the international market as the reason behind hike in the fuel prices in India.","Congress flays government over Covid death data, inflation and fuel price hike | Patna News - Times of India",6,2021

With the expert panel's recommendations, the project comes a step closer to getting the environment clearance (EC), to be given by the Union environment minister.
The expert appraisal committee (EAC) took the decision in a meeting held on Dec 17, the minutes of which were uploaded on the ministry's website on Monday.
The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is executing the project which includes development/redevelopment of Common Central Secretariat Buildings and Central Conference Centre, along with Prime Minister's Residence, SPG Building and Vice President's Enclave. It has revised the estimated project cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.
According to the minutes of the EAC meeting, the CPWD said that it will cover the impact of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report for holistic coverage of overall impacts, which means a new PMO will also come up under the Central Vista redevelopment project.
In its earlier proposal, the CPWD had not mentioned the construction of a new PMO. It had written a letter to the expert panel recently, saying that the impact of the proposed PMO will be included in the EIA report.
The expert panel said that it has deliberated upon the information provided by the CPWD and found that ""the project is now integrated in nature. After detailed deliberation, EAC recommended granting Terms of Reference.""
While granting Terms of Reference (ToR), the panel asked the developer to provide detailed demolition plan along with mitigative measures, include details of proposed strategy for management of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and efforts must be made for instant demolition of latest technique in place of extended demolition to avoid air pollution during demolition process.""
With the ToR having been granted, the CPWD now has the go-ahead to draw up the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environment Management Plan (EMP) reports and submit it to the environment ministry for final approval.
The redevelopment project of Central Vista- the nation's power corridor- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.
The proposed development/redevelopment is coming up over a total plot area measuring 5,48,776 square metre, the expert panel was told.
There will be a total built-up area of 17,21,500 square metre and the area to be demolished is 4,58,820 square metre, the panel noted.
Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, VP Residency, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan, and INS Hutments are likely to be razed for the new project.
While granting the ToR, the expert panel asked CPWD to also carry out, in its EIA report, the assessment of traffic densities and parking capabilities within five km radius from the site.
""A detailed traffic management and a traffic decongestion plan drawn up through an organization of repute and specializing in Transport Planning shall be submitted with the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). The Plan shall also include the consent of all the concerned implementing agencies,"" the committee said.
During the meeting, the project developer told the expert panel that as the buildings are situated in a very sensitive area, adequate care and precaution will be taken to reduce noise and dust while ensuring appropriate safety.
""Buildings will be fully covered from all sides with appropriate staging/barricading and covering using appropriate green cloth or sheets for full building height so as to control and contain the dust/debris within the building premises,"" the panel was told.
The panel accepted the submission of the developer that the project does not involve diversion of forest land which is why forest clearance was not required.
It also noted that the project site is not located within the eco-sensitive zone, hence wildlife clearance is also not required.
The proposed comprehensive refurbishment and augmentation of Central Vista will create new facilities for governance and public administration, render the public spaces easier to use and maintain, and will reduce disruptions caused to city traffic, the developer told the panel.
""The Central Conference Centre will cater to their conferencing needs. These will also be connected by a people mover to the Delhi Metro. Modern and secure residential facilities for the Vice President and the Prime Minister will be equipped with all necessary spaces and infrastructure, including the special protection group.
The plan for comprehensively improving and augmenting Central Vista will strengthen governance infrastructure by building an efficient and sustainable Central Secretariat to house all the Ministries of the Government of India, a Central Conference Centre to cater to all conferencing needs across Ministries, well-equipped and adequate residences for the Vice President and the Prime Minister,"" the developer told the panel.",Expert panel recommends granting environment clearance to Central Vista redevelopment project | India News - Times of India,12,2020

The CPWD has proposed to complete the Vice-President's Enclave close to the North Block by May 2022.
Though the go-ahead from the environment ministry's expert appraisal committee (EAC) for the entire Central Vista redevelopment project, which includes new Parliament Building, 10 building under Common Central Secretariat (CCS) and a massive conference centre and would cost Rs 13,450 crore, came late last month, the minutes of the meeting was made public on Monday. After receiving the approval, the CPWD had floated tender for the first three CCS buildings.

But the revised timeline which was put in the public domain has attracted criticism from several quarters. Many have questioned why these can't be deferred when the country is battling with the pandemic and looking at help from abroad to tide over the crisis.
This is grotesque. No money for oxygen and vaccines as our brothers and sisters die waiting for a hospital bed to be cremated in parking lots. BUT Modi will squander public money to feed his megalomaniac vanity. Stop this Crime,"" tweeted CPM leader Sitaram Yechury.
Even government officials, on condition of anonymity, told TOI that the government can put on hold some of these projects which have not been bid out.
Once you award a project, you create liability. So, the projects that have been awarded must not be stopped as it will also be a waste of public money. But projects for which tenders have not been awarded can be postponed,"" said one of them.

An official said the CPWD had proposed the timelines when the application for green clearance was moved three to four months back. At that point in time, there was no sign of the second wave of Covid in the country.
The official added that though the 2022 timeline has been set for the PM House and the VP House, it seems the projects will now take longer to complete.

Sources said work for the PM House and the SPG building can start only when the hutments on Dalhousie Road are shifted to new buildings at Africa Avenue and KG Marg. These two buildings are not yet ready.
Secondly, the PM House and the SPG Buildings will have to be completely high-tech considering the security and strategic reasons.
The Centre is likely to float a confidential tender"" for the PM House and assign the task on nomination rather than inviting an open tender considering strategic concerns. However, according to sources the completion of these projects is likely to take longer.

The PM House and the VP House will also have dedicated single lane tunnels connecting them to Parliament. TOI had reported about this on Mar 4. The construction of these tunnels will also take time.
The last component of this project would be the operation of an underground automated people's mover, which will connect all the buildings in the Combined Central Secretariat.

Sources said a stretch of at least 100-150 metres will be ready in Aug and people would be allowed to use this stretch to experience the change. The entire Central Vista Avenue or Rajpath and its lawns, extending from the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan up to India Gate, covering approximately 4 sq km, will be ready by Dec.

According to CPWD, around 35,000 people visited the area daily before the pandemic and this was likely to increase to 50,000 after the project gets completed. Nearly 40% of visitors are women. It is projected that the number of visitors will increase to 1.18 lakh on Republic Days compared to the earlier average of 1.05 lakh.
On Jun 12, TOI had reported how the housing and urban affairs ministry planned to release photographs of redeveloped portions with all the features, including lush green grass, trees, lights, canal, small bridge and walkways in its bid to dispel misinformation of how the project will damage pristine trees and eat up open public space.
A ministry official said by refurbishing the landscaping and lawns, the green cover was being increased from 3.5 lakh sqm to about 3.9 lakh sqm. Proper irrigation system is also being provided. Canals are being refurbished with proper lining and aerators are being provided to keep the water clean. The photographs released today only reassure this,"" an official said.

The laying of the foundation stone for a new Parliament at a time when the country is facing unprecedented challenges displays the apathy and indifference of the government towards its people. The needs of the people of India must take precedence over this project and I urge you to stop the foundation stone laying ceremony scheduled for 10th Dec 2020,"" Viswam has said.
The CPI leader also pointed out that while coronavirus has claimed close to 1.5 lakh lives and infected over 96 lakh people since Mar 2020, the pandemic had crippled the Indian economy, shot up unemployment rates.
Amidst such peril, the allocation of Rs 20,000 crore for the Central Vista Project is completely unjustified and must be stopped Keeping in mind the country's current predicament amidst the Covid-19 crisis and the deeply problematic redevelopment project, I urge you, once again, to stop the foundation stone laying ceremony and suspend the project,"" Viswam said.
PM Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the new Parliament building on Dec 10. The Supreme Court has, however, stayed all construction, demolition and translocation of trees until such time that it pronounces a judgment on all pending applications against the project.
There has been widespread criticism of the Central Vista project, including claims that due process was not followed for obtaining permissions for the project.
Earlier this month, Viswam had written to PM opposing the minimum-10-member rule for political parties to be allowed to speak during an all-party meeting called by the PM to discuss the pandemic. Viswam had said Left parties represent the poor and marginalised and should be allowed to make its representations to the government at the meeting.

A bona fide litigant who comes with clean hands would not only not suppress the facts but also wait for a few more days awaiting hearing before this hon'ble court, particularly when he has already moved the court belatedly and selectively.

The plea says the project is not an essential activity and can be put on hold during the pandemic.
Explaining the work being undertaken, the affidavit said, the scope of work for the project in question is not what is colloquially referred to as 'the Central Vista Project' (which includes Parliament, refurbishment of North Block and South Block, construction of new offices for the central government i.e. a common central secretariat, central conference facilities, etc.). The scope of work, which is the subject matter of the present petition, is limited to the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue (i.e. both sides of Rajpath) where Republic Day celebrations are held annually. This is a very important public space and most widely visited by common public and tourists in Delhi.""
It added that the scope of work includes providing public amenities like toilet blocks, paths, parking spaces, vendor zones and pedestrian underpasses below Janpath and C-Hexagon Road besides improvement of canals, bridges, lawns, lights etc.
It has been pointed out in the affidavit that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has permitted construction activities during the prevailing curfew where the labourers are staying at the site. Further, it is important to note that about 400 workers were engaged at the site of the aforementioned project well before the imposition of curfew on Apr 19, 2021. The workers are staying at the site and, therefore, the notification relied upon by the petitioner is fully complied with. The petitioner is fully aware about this fact and he has deliberately suppressed it in the petition,"" the government said.
It is submitted that in the meantime, a Covid-compliant facility was installed at the work site itself to accommodate the 250 workers who had expressed their willingness to stay put and continue the aforesaid work The facility provides for strict implementation of the Covid protocol and also adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as sanitisation, thermal screening, physical/social distancing and masking,"" the government said.
It has also said that the contractor has provided health insurance to all the workers concerned against Covid-19 and a separate facility for conducting RT-PCR tests, keeping patients in isolation and providing medical aid has also been set up at the site.
More importantly, it must be noted that pursuant to there being a dedicated medical facility at the concerned work site, the workers will have access to immediate medical attention and proper care which would otherwise have been extremely difficult, in these unprecedented times, considering the burden on our existing medical infrastructure,"" said the affidavit.",PIL on Central Vista abuse of process of law: Centre to Delhi HC | Delhi News - Times of India,5,2021

We welcome Supreme Court judgement giving go-ahead to Central Vista project: Hardeep Puri
Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday welcomed a Supreme Court judgement giving a go-ahead to the Central Vista redevelopment project, and asserted that the government has always been sensitive to environmental concerns.

A number of petitions challenged the construction of central vista project in the Lutyen's zone, alleging certain violations, including change in land use and environmental compliances.

In the backdrop of concerns raised about the environmental impact of the construction in the central vista area, the apex court directed the project proponent to install smog tower and use anti-smog guns at all construction sites.
Pronouncing its verdict on the petitions, the three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar permitted the project by 2:1 majority.

While Justice Sanjiv Khanna agreed with Justice Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari on granting permission to the project, but differed on the view to permit a change of land use.
Justice Khanna cited lack of prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) and no disclosure for public participation, as his reasons to oppose a change in land use.

Earlier, the Supreme Court on Dec 7 had allowed the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new Parliament building on Dec 10 but directed that no construction should take place.
The bench had observed that the central government may lay down the foundation stone for the Central Vista project but no construction, demolition or felling of trees shall take place for the same.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone and performed 'Bhumi Pujan' for the construction of the new Parliament building, which is a part of the Rs 20,000 crores Central Vista project on Dec 10.

The petitioners on the other hand contended they were only interested in the safety of the workers at the site and the citizens lives and compared the project to ""Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War-II.
Hard hitting arguments against the maintainability of the plea and the continuation of the project were made during the over three hour long hearing before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh which reserved its judgment in the matter.
Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the PIL, saying it lacks bona fide and the company was taking care of its workforce.
Opposing the claims of the petitioners, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the plea was a ""facade"", a ""disguise"" in the form of a PIL to stall the project which they always wanted to stop.
Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government cannot see it, then it was a ""sorry reflection"" of their concerns for the lives of the citizens.
Referring to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather ""central fortress of death"" and comparing it to ""Auschwitz"", Luthra contended that the Centre's submissions with regard to availability of medical facilities, testing centre, etc on site were all falsehoods.
He said that only empty tents have been set up at the place and there were no beds or bedding for workers to stay or sleep there.
Mehta was displeased with the project being referred to as Auschwitz saying one can criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court.
Luthra also contended that while the Centre claims some workers stayed back willingly to work on the project, no proof of their willingness has been shown.
He also said that if any facilities have been created at the site, it was for the reason that the high court agreed to hear the matter.
Countering the claims of the petitioners, the Solicitor General said one of the petitioners has been opposed to the project long before it got the go ahead from the Supreme Court in Jan this year.
He said the petitioners were not concerned for the health and safety of workers at the other constructions going on in the city.
""Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) with regard to health of workmen,"" he added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.
Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for Shapoorji Pallonji, told the court that there was no law under which he has to place on record a worker's willingness to work.
He said the petitioners cannot decide what was the safe time line for completing the project and the company had to finish it by Nov so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.
He further said that half of Rajpath has been dug up and if the work is stalled then when the monsoon comes, the pits there would fill up with water which could lead to collapse of adjacent areas and also creation of a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases.
The court was hearing the plea by Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film maker, who have contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.
The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the petition, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.

""It is not a vanity project, and this is a project of necessity,"" Puri asserted while addressing a press conference.

The Union housing and urban affairs minister tried to allay concerns over the status of some heritage buildings in the city, and said no such building will be ""touched"".
He also said a false narrative is being created over the central project.
Puri further said that the proposal for New Parliament and Central Vista redevelopment was approved much before the pandemic.
Many members of the opposition parties and civil society members have questioned the rationale behind going ahead with the Central Vista redevelopment plan as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic.
The Delhi high court on Monday allowed the construction work of the Central Vista project to continue, saying it was a ""vital and essential"" national project.
A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh dismissed a plea seeking to halt the project during the coronavirus pandemic, saying the petition was ""motivated"" and ""not a genuine PIL"".
It imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners.
The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's residence and office, and a new Vice President Enclave.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Viswam said the MPLADS fund was stopped last year so that the money could be used to fight the pandemic, but with the shortcomings of the government now exposed, the fund should be restarted.
The CPI MP said the money that is being saved by the government currently from the MPLADS funds can be ""recovered by the suspension of other projects such as the Central Vista project at a time when the country is struggling to deal with the pandemic"".
""Unfortunately, the devastating impact of the pandemic since Apr 2021 has exposed the shortcomings in the government's response as citizens have struggled to access healthcare services with many losing their lives due to the lack of essential medical supplies like oxygen and lifesaving medicines,"" he said.
""At such times, people have turned to their elected representatives for help and assistance. In order to fulfill our responsibilities towards the people and augment ongoing efforts by parliamentarians, it is imperative that the MPLADS fund be restarted immediately,"" Viswam said.
All opposition parties have been unanimous in their criticism of the government's recent move to suspend the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years, approved by the Cabinet.
The government's reason is this: to use these funds ""to strengthen the government's efforts in managing the challenges and adverse impact of COVID-19 in the country"".
Viswam also said that the MPLADS fund was specifically set up to allow MPs the right to utilise the fund for the development of their constituencies and in times of crisis, the fund is vital in allowing parliamentarians to help those in need and support the community in whatever way possible.
""With nearly 2.47 lakh people having lost their lives and over 2.27 crore cases in India, the need of the hour is to make available all avenues of help and assistance to the people of this country.

Reacting to the opposition's attacks against the government for going ahead with the two projects, sources said the parties, mainly Congress, were spreading false propaganda about Central Vista of which the under-construction projects were small parts, being developed at a cost of barely Rs 1,300 crore. MLAs bungalows in Mumbai are being constructed for Rs 900 crore whereas the new Parliament building and the Central Vista avenue together will cost Rs 1,300 crore,"" an official said.
Besides, tenders for the two projects were awarded in pre-Covid times, the official said.

Sources said over 400 workers were deployed at the two project sites where Covid-19 protocol is being complied with strictly.

Congress's criticism was premised on the party's think-tank AICC Research Department, which had made hypothetical observations about the project, the official said.

The apex court today asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra to mention the matter before the high court for urgent listing on May 10.
We are of the opinion that since the matter is pending before the high court and the order challenged in the special leave petition is only of adjournment, we are not inclined to go into the merit of the case,"" a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshari said.

It noted the submission of the senior advocate that the matter involves extreme urgency and said that the high court may consider the prayer and pass orders.
At the outset, Luthra told the bench that the matter is of extreme importance as the country is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
He said they are only concerned with the challenge to the permission granted for continuation of construction which is going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.
Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Raj Path and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of Covid infection among them,"" Luthra said.
He referred to the letter written by Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for continuation of construction work in Central Vista project on the ground that it is time bound work.
The permission was granted on the ground that it was essential activity. How is construction work an essential activity? In a health emergency, we cannot risk the lives of workers and their families and put more pressure on health care system,"" Luthra said adding that peak of second wave of Covid-19 is being anticipated by May 15 and High Court has listed the matter for May 17, which would not serve any purpose.
He said that when the nation is considering lockdown and even Indian Premier League is being shut, the construction activity cannot be allowed.
Justice Saran said, When we are sitting in closed rooms with face masks, itself shows the situation is grim. We would not like to make any further comments on the Covid situation as other benches are seized of the matter, otherwise our remarks may be misinterpreted"".
The top court disposed of the plea.
The high court has deferred the hearing on a PIL which had sought direction to Centre to halt construction work at the Central project due to prevailing Covid situation.
Petitioners Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, have claimed that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.
They have said before the high court that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the ""crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.
The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, has said.

On Jul 16, a commuter shared a video of the D2 coach, showing water was leaking from the roof onto his seat. In the last week of Jun, the roof of a toilet in the C2 compartment suddenly caved in after the train had just crossed Lonavla, causing the toilet door to break. ""Fortunately, there were no passengers in the loo at the time, otherwise it could have turned into a major incident. The railways might have fixed the snag, but the bigger picture is why do new coaches have such problems?"" asked frequent traveller Arvind Joshi.

The Deccan Queen, an iconic train of the railways and synonymous with Pune-Mumbai rail travel, needs greater attention from the authorities. The higher-ups in the Central Railway must probe the issues cropping up with the transformed rakes. They should check the quality of the rakes and ascertain whether purchases were made in a hurry. Merely fixing problems when they occur is no solution.

The new version of the DQ as of Jun 22 this year has four AC chair cars, eight second-class chair cars, one vista dome coach, one AC dining car, a guard-cum-brake van and a generator car.
Another regular passenger told TOI that most commuters were upset as cooking food has been disallowed in the train as per new regulations of the railway ministry. ""The train has a renovated dining car, but food isn't cooked in it, but brought to the train from base kitchens of stations. Many passengers have been upset about this and demand that some special trains like the Deccan Queen be excused from this regulation as it is known for its dining car and fresh breakfast meals. Now, with more recent issues in the compartments, passengers are even more upset,"" Utpal Shingote, another regular traveler, pointed out.
Rail officials said the above issues had been fixed immediately, but could not comment on larger details.

Many officials have informed the locals about this,"" said Kandhari, stating it was a clear violation of National Green Tribunal orders.
Dev Pal, a local resident and a field researcher at Housing and Land Rights Network, said, from Feb 4 onwards, around 55 trucks had been dumping waste every day with the activity generally starting after 10 pm. It has only recently been stopped after people made a complaint that these dumpers were creating a lot of noise at night. However, several hundred drops have already been made and the soil has been flattened, raising the floodplain area by several feet,"" claimed Pal, who had earlier filed a petition in Delhi High Court against removal of 70-80 jhuggis in the floodplain. We have filed an additional petition regarding dumping of earthen waste in the same case now,"" said Pal.
A Central Public Works Department official denied the claims, stating they were instead filling excavated earth in a PWD project. The allegations are not true. On PWD's request, we have filled excavated earth in a Barapullah project within clover leaves and slip road area. The area is far away from the floodplain,"" a CPWD official said.

153,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-parliament-building-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/79588951.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday will lay the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, nearly a hundred years after the foundation for the existing Parliament was laid by Duke of Connaught on Feb 12, 1921.
The ceremony will begin at 12:55 pm followed by which Bhoomi Poojan and foundation stone laying ceremony will take place at 1 pm. 'Sarva Dharma Prarthana' (inter-faith prayer) will be held at 1:30 pm.
The new building would be a four-storey structure with a seating capacity of 1,224 and cost Rs 970 crore. It would replace the existing colonial structure which would be completing hundred years in 2021.
According to a release by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the new building is an intrinsic part of the vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and will be a landmark opportunity to build peoples' Parliament for the first time after independence, one which will match the needs and aspirations of 'New India' in the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.

Here is a look at the details of the new building:
It is expected that the structure would be completed by 2022, coinciding with 75 years of India's independence.

The theme of the new building would celebrate the cultural diversity of the country. It would also incorporate regional arts and crafts. Artisans and sculptures from across the country would be employed the complete the new structure making it a symbol of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).
On the periphery of the new building, blocks will come up for the reception, information counter and public waiting area. It will be made accessible for the differently-abled. Besides the main entrance, the triangular structure will have a ceremonial entrance and one exclusively for the Speaker of Lok Sabha and Chairman of Rajya Sabha.

The structure would be built on an area of 64,500 sq m. The building will have space to accommodate 888 MPs in Lok Sabha and 384 in Rajya Sabha. The existing building can seat 543 in Lok Sabha and 245 in Rajya Sabha. The expansion has been done keeping in mind the delimitation exercise scheduled to take place in 2026.
The building will not have the iconic Central Hall present in the existing structure.
As many as 2000 people would be directly and 9000 would be indirectly involved in the construction of the building.
The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.
In Sep this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.
The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.
The existing building is a British era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi.
The Foundation Stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on Feb 12, 1921, and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on Jan 18, 1927, by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin.

The party also said that the system created in the past 70 years by previous prime ministers, including Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, has helped the country live through the tough times that it is facing today.
""The UNICEF has expressed fear that there is a threat to the world from India due to the pace at which coronavirus is spreading in the country. It has also made an appeal that maximum number of countries should help India in the fight against Covid-19. Bangladesh has sent 10,000 Remdesivir vials, while Bhutan has sent medical oxygen. Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have also offered help to 'aatmanirbhar' India,"" the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'.
""In clear terms, India is surviving on the system created by Nehru-Gandhi. Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today's rulers, India is going through that situation now,"" it said.
But while poor countries are helping India in their own way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not ready to stop the ambitious project of Central Vista worth Rs 20,000 crore, the Sena added.
The party expressed surprise that nobody feels regret that on the one hand, India accepts aid from countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, while on the other, Modi is not ready to stop work on the multi-crore Central Vista project for construction of a new Parliament building and the house of the prime minister.
The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - the power corridor of the country - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.
The Sena said that even as the world is battling a second wave of Covid-19, experts have predicted that the third wave will be more severe. But the ruling BJP is doing all it can to corner Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal even today.
""A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.
BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Union minister Nitin Gadkari be given the charge of the health ministry and this is a proof that the current union health ministry has been a complete failure, it added.
India has reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in the last 10 days. Globally, one out of the five active patients is in India. In the last ten days, 36,110 deaths have occurred. Every hour, there are 150 Covid-19 deaths in the country. We have left USA and Brazil behind in terms of deaths due to virus. The world fears India now, the Sena said.

These were the latest in a series of provocative remarks by the governor, who has been directly or indirectly targeting the BJP governments at the Centre and the states over the farmers' issue and alleged corruption.
Malik became governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Goa and Meghalaya during the Modi term.
Addressing the Global Jat Summit here, Malik said if he spoke anything on the farmers' issue it would create a controversy. But he continued with his remarks, taunting ""well-wishers"" who he said wait for him to speak.
He said ""two or three"" leaders in Delhi made him governor. ""The day they tell me that they have a problem and ask me to quit, I will not take a minute,"" he said.
""I am not a governor by birth. I am always ready to lose what I have but I cannot leave my commitment. I can quit the post but cannot see farmers suffering and getting defeated,"" he said.
He said there hasn't been an agitation earlier in the country in which ""600 people"" have died, a reference to the deaths due to various causes of protesters camping on the borders of Delhi for months against the Centre's agri laws.
""Even if a dog dies, a condolence message is sent by Delhi leaders. But I am hurt that 600 farmers have died but no resolution was passed in Parliament,"" he said.
He also referred to the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, and said he had told Modi not to antagonise Sikhs and Jats - the communities who form a bulk of the protesters.
""I had told him not to use force against them and not to send them back empty-handed. They do not forget for 300 years. When the Akal Takht was damaged, Mrs Indira Gandhi had got a yajna of mahamrityunjaya mantra performed at her farmhouse because she knew that she would be killed,"" he claimed.
""I also told the PM that you should tell the farmers 'I am right and you are wrong' but I still accept your viewpoint because I cannot see your suffering',"" he said.
By saying this, the PM will gain in stature, Malik argued.
He repeated his suggestion that the issue can be resolved through a guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).
He claimed that Army has felt the impact of the agitation over the central laws as the farmers' sons also serve in the military.
""Anything can happen. Today, you are in power and are arrogant and do not know what repercussions would follow. When Kargil happens, the sons of these farmers are sent to the hills to fight.""
He said people could react to ""injustice"" some day. ""I do not want the day to come when farmers react,"" he added.
Referring to the Republic Day violence when protesters in their tractors headed to the capital's Red Fort, he said after the prime minister it is the right of farmers to hoist the national flag there.

The government informed the court that the powerful offices housed in South and North Block where the Prime Minister's Office, defence, home and finance ministries are located, will be converted into museums to showcase the pre-Sepoy Mutiny and post-1857 events once the entire Central Vista project is completed.
Attempting to counter challenges to the project that aims to construct a new Parliament building, central secretariat as well as office premises for ministries in a phased manner, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna that since the construction was to be taken up in a phased manner, environmental clearances were being obtained on the basis of requirement.
The Parliament project and the remaining Central Vista redevelopment are different projects and the planning in respect of such projects is carried out in different stages. Execution of different projects shall be taken up in phases. Considering the detailed nature of the application required for seeking environment clearance, it is appropriate that the said clearance is applied for only when the building/project is in the final form so as to ensure that full and complete details are mentioned in the application for environmental clearance,"" the Centre said.
The government said the buildings had become old and construction of new ones would also save money. It said many government offices were running from rented premises and crores was spent as rent over the years and this amount could be saved as there would be sufficient space to accommodate all offices in the new buildings.
The Centre said the Central Hall of Parliament would be retrofitted and used for ceremonial purposes. The remaining area of the Parliament building would be used for housing Parliament staff and chambers of MPs.
The entire Parliament building will be retrofitted to restrict further deterioration and also reduce the stress on the building by limiting its usage,"" the Centre said.
It said in the absence of a common secretariat building even after 73 years of independence, some ministries were housed in the Central Vista complex while others were located in different parts of Delhi.
Various ministries, due to lack of space, have hired premises on rent, which runs into thousands of crores of rupees and is paid by the central government,"" it added. As there was no common central secretariat and ministries were spread over different locations, it resulted in administrative inefficiency and difficulty in inter-departmental coordination, it said.
The Centre said except North Block and South Block and one or two other buildings, the rest could not be categorised as heritage buildings.",Centre bats for Central Vista project in SC | Delhi News - Times of India,11,2020

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project against which various pleas have been filed.
A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna will pronounce the verdict on the batch of pleas on which it had reserved its verdict on Nov 5, last year.
On Dec 7, last year the top court had allowed the Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project on Dec 10 after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue.
Centre had told the bench that there would be only foundation stone-laying ceremony, and no construction, demolition or felling of trees would be done for the project as of now.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone on Dec 10, last year, for the new Parliament building and the construction is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had said on Dec 5, last year.
The apex court had earlier said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be ""at their own risk"".
It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.
On Nov 5, the apex court had reserved its verdict on a batch of pleas which have raised questions over the Centre's ambitious Central Vista project, which covers three km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.
The Centre had earlier argued in the top court that the project would ""save money"" which is paid as rent for housing central government ministries in the national capital.
It had submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.
The Centre had also said there was no arbitrariness or favouritism in selecting consultant for the project and the argument that the government could have adopted a better process cannot be a ground to scrap the project.
Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the project to redevelop the Central Vista.
The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the nod to change of land use.
The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.
One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.
The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on Feb 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.
The stay order of the high court on the single judge bench's Feb 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

These land parcels will pave the way for construction of new offices for MPs. The staff in these two existing buildings will be temporarily shifted to an office complex coming up on K G Marg and once all the 10 building blocks get completed along the Rajpath, these offices will be permanently shifted there.
In government records, the two office buildings are on a single plot. These two buildings don't fall under the Central Vista Zone. According to the development plan, there would be a tunnel across Parliament Street to connect the building with chambers of MPs in the Parliament complex. Sources said providing office space to MPs has also been taken up as a priority.
The Central Public Works Department is constructing two office complexes "" one on K G Marg and another in Africa Avenue "" for temporary shifting of offices and these will be ready in the next one year. Hence the process of shifting offices from Transport and Shram Shakti Bhavan may start by the end of 2021.

The plea stated that at a time when Delhi is grappling with a devastating coronavirus outbreak and when all efforts, particularly and more so by the state and its agencies, have to be towards controlling the spiraling situation, the impugned acts of the respondents will nullify and negate all those efforts.
The plea also states that the petitioners are also questioning why or how the project constitutes an ""essential service"", merely because some executive mandated contractual deadline has to be met.

The project intends to revamp 86 acres of land in Delhi, which includes Rajpath, Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, North Block, and South Block, Shastri Bhavan, India Gate, and Udyog Bhavan. The project envisages the construction of a new Parliament building, a common secretariat for central government offices, the Prime Minister's office, and residence, the Special Protection Group building, and Vice-President Enclave.

The construction work could not start earlier as the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decided the pending pleas on the issue.
The new structure will come up in front of the existing Parliament that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.
The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have an additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.

The 'Deccan Queen' had its inaugural run on 1st Jun 1930 which was a major landmark in the history of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the forerunner of the Central Railway. This was the first deluxe train introduced on the railway to serve 2 important cities of the region i.e. Mumbai and Pune and was aptly named as 'Queen of Deccan' ('Dakkhan ki Rani').
Initially, the train was introduced with 7 coaches having only first class and second class accommodation. Third class was introduced in 1955. The coaches of the original rakes were replaced in 1966 by anti-telescopic steel bodied integral coaches built by Integral Coach Factory, Perambur and no of coaches were increased to 12. *The Vistadome coach was attached from Aug 15, 2021.

178,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-okays-central-vista-and-new-parliament-projects-in-two-to-one-majority/articleshow/80124493.cms,"NEW DELHI: A three-judge Supreme Court bench on Tuesday by two to one majority green signalled the high political significance Central Vista and new Parliament building projects, that would create larger working space for efficient functioning of the country's highest legislative wing and integrated administrative block for ministries and departments of the Union government in the heart of New Delhi.
The majority judgment, authored by Justice A M Khanwilkar for himself and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, repelled concerted challenge to the change of land use under the city's Master Plan, grant of statutory and other permissions as well as the environmental and heritage clearances, selection of project consultant and non-holding of design competition for final shape of the project. ""It is not legally binding upon the project proponent to conduct a design competition for a project of this nature,"" the SC said.
It also rejected repeated requests of the petitioners to expand and enhance the scope of scrutiny of developmental projects at the behest of a few who disagreed with the proposed project of the government, which it said represented collective wisdom. The SC noted that the 93-year-old Parliament building, a grade-I heritage building, would be retrofitted and put to ceremonial use.

The majority judgment said: ""we feel constrained to note that in the present case, the petitioners enthusiastically called upon us to venture into territories that are way beyond the contemplated powers of a constitutional court. We are compelled to wonder if we, in the absence of a legal mandate, can dictate the government to desist from spending money on one project and instead use it for something else, or if we can ask the government to run their offices only from areas decided by this Court, or if we can question the wisdom of the government in focusing on a particular direction of development.""
""We are equally compelled to wonder if we can jump to put a full stop on execution of policy matters in the first instance without a demonstration of irreparable loss or urgent necessity, or if we can guide the government on moral or ethical matters without any legal basis. In light of the settled law, we should be loath to venture into these areas,"" Justices Kahnwilkar and Maheshwari said.
In his 179-page dissenting judgment, Justice Sanjiv Khanna did not fault the decision of the government to build a new Parliament building, which would be required to accommodate an increased number of seats in the two Houses after the delimitation exercise scheduled for 2026. However, he struck down the statutory, environmental clearances as well as the notification for change of land use.
In the 432-page majority judgment, Justice Khanwilkar accepted all the points argued by solicitor general Tushar Mehta and found the supporting documents given by him repudiating the allegations of a large number of petitioners, who were led by senior advocate Shyam Divan.
Justice Khanwilkar and Maheshwari said, ""We hold that there is no infirmity in the grant of: (a) No Objection"" by the Central Vista Committee (CVC); (b) Approval"" by the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) as per the DUAC Act, 1973; and (c) Prior approval"" by the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) under clause 1.12 of the Building Byelaws for Delhi, 2016.""
""We further hold that the exercise of power by the Central Government under Section 11A(2) of the DDA Act, 1957 is just and proper and thus the modifications regarding change in land use of plot Nos. 2 to 8 in the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021/Zonal Development Plan for Zone-D and Zone-C vide impugned notification dated Mar 20, 2020 stands confirmed,"" the bench said.
""Recommendation of Environmental Clearance (EC) by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and grant thereof by Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change is just, proper and in accordance with law including the 2006 Notification. We uphold the same along with appropriate directions therein to ensure that the highlighted mitigating measures are followed by the project proponent in their letter and spirit,"" it said.
The only additional direction given to the project proponent by the apex court was to set up smog towers of adequate capacity in the new Parliament building and use ""smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase is in progress on the site"". It asked the MoEF to consider issuing an omnibus direction for installation of smog towers in all future major development projects, both government and private, while granting environmental clearance, given the city's bad track record in air quality. It said smog guns should also be deployed during construction activity periods.
Justice Khanwilkar clarified that the stage of prior permission, under the Building Bye Laws of the Heritage Conservation Committee, is the stage when actual work for the development/re-development commences and not the incipient stage of planning and formalisation of the Project.
""Accordingly, the concerned authorities/project proponent shall obtain aforementioned prior permission of the designated Authority before actually starting any development/redevelopment work on the stated plots/structures/precincts governed by the heritage laws including on plot No. 118 (new Parliament building), if already not obtained,"" the bench said.
The petitioners had initially challenged the Central Vista Project before a single judge bench of the Delhi High Court, which on Feb 11 last year had directed DDA to approach the HC if it intended to permit change in land use for the Central Vista. On Centre's appeal, a division bench of the HC on Feb 28 stayed the Single Judge's order. The petitioners had moved the SC, which on Mar 6 had withdrawn the entire matter from the HC to itself and conducted an elaborate hearing on the issue for days together.

We're ready with the proposal and it will be sent to the committee soon. All norms are being followed strictly.

We have maintained since the beginning that no heritage structure will be demolished during the redevelopment of Central Vista,"" said a ministry official.
The apex court, in its order, has directed the government to obtain prior permission from the HCC before actually starting any development or redevelopment work on the plots and the structures governed by the heritage laws.

While validating the statutory and environmental clearances given to proposed new Parliament building and Central Vista Project, a three-judge bench by two to one majority hinted that it was drawn into examining in detail, expending considerable judicial time by granting opportunity for elaborate arguments to petitioners and the government, the clearances to the projects on the basis of allegations, which were found unsubstantiated.
The majority, Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, said, ""The tool of public interest litigation or 'social interest litigation', as it is more appropriately called, was devised to open the doors of the constitutional Courts for remedying glaring injustices against humans, that is, for securing constitutional rights.""
""It was never meant to transform the constitutional Court as a superlative authority over day-to-day governance. Judicial time is not meant for undertaking a roving enquiry or to adjudicate upon unsubstantiated flaws or shortcoming in policy matters of Government of the day and politicise the same to appease the dissenting group of citizens  be it in the guise of civil society or a political outfit,"" they said.

""The foregoing comments are not because the Courts feel burdened by untenable and frivolous claims but to highlight that Court time saved would be time-earned to be best spent on more deserving claims of have-nots due to long incarceration, affecting liberty, denial of pension and salary, motor accident claims, land acquisition compensation, including genuine corporate resurrection and revival to benefit large number of workmen and investors etc... We need to say so because we had to spend considerable time and energy on this matter (lest the petitioners entertain a feeling of having been denied a fair opportunity), despite the pandemic situation, which at the end, we find to be devoid of substance,"" the SC said.
The SC said the route of public/social interest litigation is being increasingly invoked to call upon the Court to examine pure concerns of policy and sorts of generalised grievances against the system. ""No doubt, the Courts are repositories of immense public trust and the fact that some public interest actions have generated commendable results is noteworthy, but it is equally important to realise that Courts operate within the boundaries defined by the Constitution. We cannot be called upon to govern. For, we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise in that regard,"" it said.
Justices Khanwilkar and Maheshwari said political issues, including regarding development policies of the Government of the day, must be debated in the Parliament, to which the government is accountable. ""The role of the Court is limited to examining the constitutionality including legality of the policy and Government actions. The right to development is a basic human right and no organ of the State is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law,"" it said.
Referring to increased use of environment clearance as an issue to question development projects, the SC said, ""Indubitably, environment and development are not sworn enemies of each other. It would be an anomalous approach to consider the environment as a hurdle in development and vice-versa.""
Emphasising the concept of sustainable development, the SC said, ""The right to development is intrinsically connected to the preservance of a dignified life. It is not limited to the idea of infrastructural development, rather, it entails human development as the basis of all development. The jurisprudence in environmental matters must acknowledge that there is immense inter-dependence between right to development and right to natural environment.""",SC or HCs can't become 'superlative authorities' through PILs | Delhi News - Times of India,1,2021

Soon after the judgment, Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri told TOI's Dipak Dash that the project was a necessity. Excerpts:
The Supreme Court has given a green signal for the project. Is it a big relief for the government?
This is a very major step. A point often forgotten is that we are a 7,000-year-old civilisation and our history as a republic is a very small part. We were subjected to foreign invasion. Today we have a Parliament building which is 93 years' old. It was never designed to be the legislature (bicameral chambers) of an independent country. When the current building was constructed, it was not the mindset of the colonial power to grant India independence. That came much later. Many countries which became independent, some within 20-25 years, and some after a few more years, constructed their Parliament building. But there is something more. Now a democratically elected government of independent India is constructing the temple of democracy for posterity, for the next 200 to 250 years. There was a global competition for design and best shortlisted companies participated in the bidding process. We followed the process and intend completing it by the winter session of Parliament in 2022.

Gujarat, Himachal Election Results 2022 Live Updates: Party's high command to decide on Himachal CM, say Congress MLAs

So, it was long overdue?
The significance lies partly in a demand which has been around for a long time and now somebody has got the ability and political bandwidth to complete it. To say that it's a vanity project is not right, it's a posterity project. Vanity is coming from those who don't understand it. Now the same people are opposing who once talked about the need for a new Parliament. To give an example, a sitting MP from a particular party, which was the ruling party, had given an interview to a newspaper in 2012 saying there was a need for a new Parliament and the current one is inadequate. The deterioration of the building is problematic. Today the building lies in seismic zone-IV. Surely, a responsible government can't wait till it goes wrong.
Will you take the matter to the heritage committee?
Of course, so far as heritage and green cover, I have always maintained that as minister of this department, we will follow and go strictly by the rule book. I have gone through the 600-plus page judgment. The judges have made some suggestions and we welcome them like making the smog tower an integral part of the building and also asking the environment ministry to make these as built-in provisions for the large projects.
How do you respond to questions raised on the timing of the project especially when we are battling a pandemic?
This is a project they (earlier government) initiated in 2012. When we started working on this project, we did not anticipate the pandemic. But what is the suggestion over the timing "" should we shelve it for next 4-5 years? We have an outflow of nearly Rs 1,000 crore annually on rentals. The good thing about pandemic is we have got the vaccine done "" Atmanirbhar and Made in India vaccine.

""The petitioners have argued at length as to why the present case calls for a heightened judicial review... We are compelled to wonder as to what could be the circumstances, if at all any, wherein the Court not only surpasses the boundaries reserved for its oversight in the Constitution but also provides it an express recognition by acknowledging a heightened review,"" said Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Mheshwari, who formed the majority in a three-judge bench that green lighted the two projects.
""Would it be justified for the Court to innovate and elevate the standard of review after a decision has already been taken by the executive in accordance with the procedure established by law, in pursuance of a policy,"" they asked.
Rejecting the petitioners' plea, Justice Khanwilkar said, ""there is absolutely no legal basis to 'heighten' the judicial review by applying yardstick beyond the statutory scheme and particularly when the Government has accorded no special status to the project and has gone through the ordinary route of such development projects as per law."" The court said such a proposition (heightened judicial review) for select projects is ""fraught with unforeseen consequences and replete with uncertainties"".
The SC said, ""Once the Government decides to construct a new space for its sitting or to construct a highway or water dam or school or university and follows the procedure prescribed under law commensurate with the nature of project, then the Court cannot act as a multiplier of regulations and add its own notion as to what ought to be additional essential procedure for going ahead with a particular project.""
""In a democracy, the electors repose their faith in the elected Government which is accountable to the legislature and expect it to adopt the best possible course of action in public interest. Thus, an elected Government is the repository of public faith in matters of development,"" it said.
""Some section of the public/citizens may have another viewpoint if not complete disagreement with the course of action perceived by the elected Government, but then, the dispensation of judicial review cannot be resorted to by the aggrieved/dissenting section for vindication of their point of view until and unless it is demonstrated that the proposed action is in breach of procedure established by law or in a given case, colourable exercise of powers of the Government,"" it said.
""Therefore, it is important for the Courts to remain alive to all the attending circumstances and not interfere merely because another option as in the perception of the aggrieved/dissenting section of public would have been a better option,"" Justices Khanwilkar and Maheshwari said.",Level of scrutiny can't be 'heightened' for important projects: SC | Delhi News - Times of India,1,2021

A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, by 2:1 majority, held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for the project were valid.
Justice Khanna wrote separate 179-page dissenting judgement on the aspects of public participation on interpretation of the statutory provisions, failure to take prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) and the order passed by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC).
The apex court judge, however, agreed with Justices A M Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari on the majority on the aspects of Notice inviting Bid, award of consultancy and the order of the Urban Arts Commission, as a standalone and independent order.

""The Central government could not have notified the modified the land use changes, without following the procedure and without prior approval/permission from the Heritage Conservation Committee. Further, the local body is expressly interdicted from issuing building permits in respect of the listed heritage buildings/precincts.
""New Delhi Municipal Council should have approached the Heritage Conservation Committee for clarification/confirmation and proceed on their advice,"" Justice Khanna wrote.
He said public participation is not to be a mechanical exercise or formality and it must comply with the least and basic requirements so that it is fruitful and constructive.
""Thus, mere uploading of the gazette notification giving the present and the proposed land use with plot numbers was not sufficient compliance, but rather an exercise violating the express as well as implied stipulations, that is, necessity and requirement to make adequate and intelligible disclosure,"" he said.
Justice Khanna further said that the whole purpose of outsourcing the task to EAC, comprised of experts and specialists, is to have a proper evaluation on the basis of some objective criteria.
""EAC is a body that has to apply its collective mind and not to record conclusions. There must be application of mind which is reflected when reasons justifying the conclusion are recorded. Mere reproduction of the contesting stands is not sufficient.
""On the contrary it would reflect mechanical grant without application of mind. Further, it is not for the court/appellate forum to assume what weighed, whether the conclusion relies on material which is relevant, irrelevant or partly relevant, or whether the decision is partly based on surmises and conjectures and partly on evidence,"" he said.
He said the citizenry clearly had the right to know intelligible details explaining the proposal to participate and express themselves, give suggestions and submit objections.
Observing that the proposed changes would be largely irreversible, Justice Khanna said the physical construction or demolition once done, cannot be undone or corrected for future by repeal, amendment or modification as in case of most policies or even enactments.
""They have far more permanent consequences. It was therefore necessary for the respondents to inform and put in public domain the redevelopment plan, layouts, etc. with justification and explanatory memorandum relating to the need and necessity, with studies and reports.
""Of particular importance is whether by the changes, the access of the common people to the green and other areas in the Central Vista would be curtailed/restricted and the visual and integrity impact, and proposed change in use of the iconic and heritage buildings,"" he said.
Justice Khanna quashed the final notification of modification/change of the land use dated Mar 28, 2020 in respect of the six plots in the Central Vista and directed the Central government to put on public domain on the web, intelligible and adequate information along with drawings, layout plans, with explanatory memorandum etc. within a period of 7 days.
He also directed that a public advertisement be out on the website of the concerned authority and the Central government along with appropriate publication in the print media be made within seven days.
""Anyone desirous of filing suggestions/objections may do so within four weeks from the date of publication. Objections/ suggestions can be sent by e-mail or to the postal address which would be indicated/mentioned in the public notice.
""The public notice would also notify the date, time and place when public hearing, which would be given by the Heritage Conservation Committee to the persons desirous of appearing before the said Committee. No adjournment or request for postponement would be entertained. However, the Heritage Conservation Committee may if required fix additional date for hearing,"" he said.

""Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the central vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,"" it further alleged.
The former civil servants also wondered what locus standi the prime minister has to lay the foundation stone of the Parliament building.
""The prime minister is the head of the executive, not of the legislature. For a building that will accommodate the two Houses of Parliament, the appropriate protocol would have been for the President of India to lay the foundation stone.

In less than three hours, the twin towers of the World Trade Center were reduced to a mountain of twisted metal and rubble, killing more than 2,700 people, while hundreds more were killed at the Pentagon. All three were destroyed by men armed with nothing more than parcel knives hijacking fuel-laden passenger aircraft.
America was under attack. It came not long after after George W. Bush had formed his new administration with highly influential neoconservatives and assertive realists at the Pentagon and State Department, as well as in the White House itself. All were determined to see the vision of a new American century"" fulfilled  a neoliberal free market world rooted in US experience and guided by its post-cold war progress as the world's sole economic and military superpower.
At the time, commentators compared the attack to Pearl Harbor, but the effect of 9/11 was much greater. Pearl Harbor had been an attack by the naval forces of a state already in great tension with the United States. It was against a military base in the pre-television age and away from the continental United States. The 9/11 attack was a much greater shock, and if war with Japan was a consequence of Pearl Harbor, then there would be war after 9/11 even if the perpetrators and those behind them were scarcely known to the American public.
The vision of the new American century had to be secured and force of arms was the way to do it, initially against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
A few people argued against war at the time, seeing it as a trap to suck the US into an Afghanistan occupation instead of treating 9/11 as an act of appalling mass criminality, but their voices did not count.
The first war on terror""  against al-Qaida and the Taliban  started within a month, lasted barely two months and seemed an immediate success. It was followed by Bush's State of the Union address in Jan 2002 declaring an extended war against what Bush referred to as an axis of evil"" of rogue states intent on supporting terror and developing weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq was the priority, with Iran and North Korea in the frame. The Iraq War started in Mar 2003 and was apparently over by May 1, when Bush gave his mission accomplished"" speech from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln.
That was the high point of the entire US-led war on terror"". Afghanistan was the first disaster, with the Taliban moving back into rural areas within two to three years and going on to fight the US and its allies for 20 years before taking back control last month.
In Iraq, even though the insurgents appeared defeated by 2009 and the US could withdraw its forces two years later, Islamic State (IS) rose phoenix-like from the ashes. That led to the third conflict, the intense 2014-18 air war across northern Iraq and Syria, fought by the US, the UK, France and others, killing tens of thousands of IS supporters and several thousand civilians.
Even after the collapse of its caliphate in Iraq and Syria, IS arose once again like the proverbial phoenix, spreading its influence as far afield as the Saharan Sahel, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, southern Thailand, the Philippines, back in Iraq and Syria once more and even Afghanistan. The spread across the Sahel was aided by the collapse of security in Libya, the 2011 NATO-led intervention being the fourth of the west's failed wars in barely 20 years.
In the face of these bitter failures, we have two linked questions: was 9/11 the beginning of decades of a new world disorder? And where do we go from here?
9/11 in context
It is natural to see the single event of 9/11 as turning traditional military postures on their heads, but that is misleading. There were already changes afoot, as two very different events in Feb 1993, eight years before the attacks, had shown all too well.
First, incoming US president, Bill Clinton, had appointed James Woolsey as the new director of the CIA. Asked at his Senate confirmation hearing how he would characterise the end of the cold war, he replied that the US had slain the dragon (the Soviet Union) but now faced a jungle full of poisonous snakes.
During the 1990s, and very much in line with Woolsey's phrase, the US military moved from a cold war posture to preparing for small wars in far-off places. There was more emphasis on long-range air strike systems, amphibious forces, carrier battle groups and special forces. By the time Bush was elected in Nov 2000, the US was far more prepared to tame the jungle.
Second, the US military and most analysts around the world missed the significance of a new phenomenon, the rapidly improving ability of the weak to take up arms against the strong. Yet the signs were already there. On Feb 26 1993, not long after Woolsey had talked of a jungle full of snakes, an Islamist paramilitary group attempted to destroy the World Trade Center with a massive truck bomb placed in the underground car park of the North Tower. The plan was to collapse it over the adjoining Vista Hotel and the South Tower, destroying the entire complex and killing upwards of 30,000 people.
The attack failed  though six people died  and the significance of the attack was largely missed even though there were many other indicators of weakness in the 1990s. In Dec 1994, an Algerian paramilitary group tried to crash an Airbus passenger jet on Paris, an attack foiled by French special forces during a refuelling stop at Marseilles. A month later a bombing by the LTTE of the Central Bank in Colombo, Sri Lanka devastated much of the central business district of Colombo, killing over 80 and injuring more than 1,400 people.
A decade before the first World Trade Center attacks, 241 Marines had been killed in a single bombing in Beirut (another 58 French paratroopers were killed by a second bomb in their barrack) and between 1993 and 2001 there were attacks in the Middle East and East Africa including the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, an attack on the USS Cole in Aden Harbour and the bombing of US diplomatic missions in Tanzania and Kenya.
The 9/11 attacks did not change the world. They were further steps along a well-signed path leading to two decades of conflict, four failed wars and no clear end in sight.
What now?
That long path, though, has from the start had within it one fundamental flaw. If we are to make sense of wider global trends in insecurity, we have to recognise that in all the analysis around the 9/11 anniversary there lies the belief that the main security concern must be with an extreme version of Islam. It may seem a reasonable mistake, given the impact of the wars, but it still misses the point. The war on terror is better seen as one part of a global trend which goes well beyond a single religious tradition  a slow but steady move towards revolts from the margins.
In writing my book, Losing Control, in the late 1990s  a couple of years before 9/11  I put it this way: What should be expected is that new social movements will develop that are essentially anti-elite in nature and will draw their support from people, especially men, on the margins. In different contexts and circumstances, they may have their roots in political ideologies, religious beliefs, ethnic, nationalist or cultural identities, or a complex combination of several of these.
They may be focused on individuals or groups, but the most common feature is an opposition to existing centres of power  What can be said is that, on present trends, anti-elite action will be a core feature of the next 30 years  not so much a clash of civilisations, more an age of insurgencies.
This stemmed from the view that the primary factors in global insecurity were a combination of increasing socioeconomic divisions and environmental limits to growth coupled with a security strategy rooted in preserving the status quo. Woolsey's jungle full of snakes"" could be seen as a consequence of this, but there would be military responses available to keep the lid on problems  liddism"" in short.
More than two decades down the road, socioeconomic divisions have worsened, the concentration of wealth has reached levels best described as obscene and has even increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, itself leading to food shortages and increased poverty.
Meanwhile climate change is now with us, is accelerating towards climate breakdown with, once again, the greatest impact on marginalised societies. It therefore makes sense to see 9/11 primarily as an early and grievous manifestation of the weak taking up arms against the strong, and that military response in the current global security environment woefully misses the point.
At the very least there is an urgent need to rethink what we mean by security, and time is getting short to do that.

The HC accepted the Centre's stand that all Covid-related precautions have been taken to protect the workers engaged on the project site from the viral infection, and noted that we see no reason to stop the work"" since these workers are staying onsite during the curfew in compliance with DDMA guidelines.
A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said challenge to the ongoing construction activity with regard to one particular project, is a pointer to the ill-intent and lack of bonafides of the petitioners in filing the present petition"" pointing out that the legality of the project was already upheld by the Supreme Court in Jan.
Once the SC gave its nod, the work has to be completed within time-bound schedule, the bench noted, adding that construction activity of this essential project or of a project of national importance cannot be stopped especially when the conditions imposed by the order of the DDMA are not flouted or violated"".
The HC also rejected the stand of the two petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi that the work is not essential activity"". It underlined that the project in question is of vital importance and essential and has a direct nexus with the main project, namely, Central Vista Project.""
By no stretch of imagination, the HC observed, can it be said that Central Vista Project (which is the main project) or Central Vista avenue redevelopment project is not an essential project. The Central Vista avenue redevelopment project, which is a subset of the main project, is equally important and essential as the main project"". It said once a court is satisfied that workers are staying at the site and all facilities have been provided by the contractor, Covid-19 protocols are adhered to and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is being followed, there is no reason for this court to stop the project"".
The bench also took note that petitioners casually argued that the time limit can be extended. Such kind of arguments cannot be accepted by this court,"" the HC said, noting that we are of the view that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners and not a genuine PIL. In view of that, the petition is dismissed with costs of Rs 1 lakh to be deposited by the petitioners with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority within four weeks from today.""
The court agreed with the argument of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the public interest touted by the two petitioners is very selective"" as they ignored other construction works that are going on in the vicinity. The bench noted that several other agencies like CPWD, NBCC, DMRC, PWD, IICC and DDA are undertaking construction projects in Delhi and said it is obvious that petitioners have selectively chosen only one project which is of national importance, at a vital place where Republic Day celebrations are held in Delhi and is a part and parcel of the larger project, namely Central Vista Project"".","Delhi HC calls Central Vista 'vital', junks PIL as 'motivated'; fines petitioners 1 lakh | India News - Times of India",6,2021

Democracy in India is constantly being renewed. In India, we are seeing voter turnout increasing with every election.

Usually, when democracy is discussed elsewhere, it is about election procedures, governance and administration. Putting more emphasis on these systems is called democracy.

Democracy is a culture in India. Democracy is a life value, a way of life and the soul of the life of the nation for India. Democracy of India is a system developed with the experience of centuries.

Democracy in India has always been a means of resolving differences along with governance. Different views, different perspectives, they empower a vibrant democracy. There is always room for differences but there should never be a disconnect, our democracy has moved ahead with this goal.

""...we appreciate that your good office has undertaken a detailed internal review and thoroughly discussed and evaluated all the issues and concerns,"" a source said quoting the letter sent to the executive engineer Central Vista Project Division-1, CPWD.
In the letter, SP Group further said,""We also appreciate your confirmation that the entire bidding process was carried out impartially in a very fair and transparent manner and that there exists no conflict of interest between TCE (Tata Consulting Engineers) and TPL (Tata Projects Ltd).""
Earlier in Sep, SP had sent two letters to CPWD alleging that the participation of both TPL and TCE in the process was a violation of the Central Vigilance Commission rules.
Moreover, it had also alleged that the pre-qualification bid criteria was tweaked so as to make it possible for TPL to take part in the bidding process.
""Our earlier communication of 10th and 17th Sep 2020 was just to understand the limited issue if at all there exists even a smallest probable conflict of interest in the bidding process which is resolved,"" the letter added.
SP Group further said, ""Based on your aforesaid justification and clarification, we shall not pursue the matter any further.""
Comments from SP Group could not be immediately obtained.
In Sep this year, TPL won the bid to construct a new Parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore ahead of L&T Ltd which had submitted a bid of Rs 865 crore.
Out of seven companies shortlisted, only three -- Tata Projects, L&T and SP Group -- were selected for the final round of bidding.
According to sources, SP Group did not participate in the final tendering process.
The new Parliament building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project, and it is expected to be completed in 21 months. As per CPWD, the new building will come up at plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate and the existing Parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project.

Tata Sons is the holding company of the over $100 billion conglomerate, Tata Group. It had objected to SP Group's plans to raise funds by pledging shares of Tata Sons.
The Mistry family, however had stated that it was ""in the midst of raising funds against the security of their personal assets to meet the crisis arising from the global pandemic"" and SP Group had alleged that Tata Sons ""amplified its institutional efforts to suppress and inflict irreparable harm on the SP Group, in the midst of a global crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic"".",SP Group withdraws letters alleging irregularities in bidding process for new Parliament building - Times of India,10,2020

JNB was constructed at a cost of Rs 220 crore and was the first government building to get the prestigious 'Green Building' certification.
Officials confirmed the plan and even the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has included this building in the redevelopment project. CPWD has submitted the proposal seeking green clearance for 10 new buildings for Common Central Secretariat (CCS), conference hall, new PMO, PM residence and Vice President Enclave, which TOI had reported on Nov 22.
Construction work of the Central Vista project may extend till 2026 instead of the earlier deadline of 2024, due to the pandemic. The main reason behind replacing the JNB is underutilisation of land, officials said. Currently the building with a built-up area of nearly 60,000 sq meters has three main interconnected blocks  one of three storeys and two of five storeys, four distinct zones with separate entrances.

A government official said they had received reports of trees being transplanted to locations over 20km from the original site, such as NTPC ecopark in Badarpur. The office of environment minister Gopal Rai had permitted trees to be transplanted in the vicinity of the original site, for which eight pockets were selected.
We have sought details and will take suitable action if any violations are found,"" a Delhi government statement said on Wednesday.
Under the transplantation policy, at least 80% of trees in any large construction project need to be transplanted, while compulsory afforestation would have to be done in the ratio of 1:10. This means that in addition to transplantation of 404 trees, another 4,040 saplings have to be planted.
Since Sep 9, all permissions to fell or prune trees, including transplantation by large construction projects, were being sent directly to Rai's office. An inter nal circular had been issued to the forest and wildlife department to give no further permissions for the same.
A forest official said a list of tree species, which were more likely to survive transplantation, had been prepared, while invasive species would not be shifted out from any project.
An NTPC spokesperson said though trees had been transplanted, they were unaware how many of them had actually reached the eco-park site. We are looking into the number of trees that may have been transplanted,"" added the spokesperson.
Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge of Yamuna Biodiversity Park in north Delhi, said ficus species like banyan or peepal could survive transplantation more easily than others. However, the age of the tree mattered too. For trees less than 10 years old, the success rate will be much higher and easier to transplant as their root spread is not much and food requirement is lower. We have seen older species that were transplanted not perform very well ecologically,"" he added.

The project will be awarded after scrutiny and going by the practice, the lowest bidder would bag the project.

Though the government had targeted to complete the new Parliament building by Jul 2022, the timeline has been pushed by at least six months due to Covid. Since there will be only one basement, the project can be completed in nearly 24 months though there will be a lot of stone work to sync the new building with the existing Parliament,"" said a source.

On the NSE, at the end of a volatile session, the Nifty index closed 118 points, or 0.7%, down at 16,451.
Late on Wednesday, the minutes from the US Fed's policy meeting showed that several of its members were in favour of scaling down the magnitude of the bond-buying programme from its current level. As and when the Fed takes that route, it would become more difficult for global investors to have access to cheaper funds. This unnerved investors across the world and led to selling in several markets, including here. This also impacted investor sentiment on Dalal Street. In addition, rising Covid cases also led to selling, brokers and dealers said.
According to Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, global markets continue to be under selling pressure as investors fret over signs of US Fed considering reducing stimulus this year while new lockdowns in countries facing surging cases of the Covid-19 Delta variant dampened the outlook.

The bill was passed in Rajya Sabha with a voice vote.
Lok Sabha had passed the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020 bill earlier this week.
It will replace the Salary, Allowances And Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, that was cleared by the Cabinet on Apr 6 and promulgated the next day.
The Upper House also passed the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which proposes to reduce the salaries and allowances of ministers by 30 per cent for a year.
Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
Both bills were taken up simultaneously and passed by voice vote.
While supporting the cuts in salaries, most Opposition members who participated in the discussion urged the government to review its decision to suspend the Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) scheme for two years saying it was necessary to carry out development works in their respective constituencies.
Union minister Pralhad Joshi said this was a temporary suspension.
During the debate, Joshi said it did not matter how much money was being saved through salary cuts of members. ""Charity should begin from home and that is the concept we have started. It is not Rs 4 crore saving as said by DMK member but Rs 53.9 crore per year from members' salary,"" he said.
DMK member P Wilson had earlier during the discussion said the measure would entail savings of just Rs 4 crore.
On several opposition members asking the government to stop various projects like Bullet train and construction of a new Parliament building to cut costs, Joshi said, ""First you say public spending should be increased and now you are demanding that all these projects should be stopped"".
""At least we don't pay to some private trust from PM Relief fund. These people raised similar issues in 2019 election and people have answered,"" Joshi further said.
Reddy said COVID-19 has impacted the incomes of people working in the private sector and so the Prime Minister initiated this bill which entails 30 per cent reduction in ministers' salaries.
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said around 70 per cent MPs depend on their salaries and have to take care of every expense through these emoluments alone.
He said MPLAD funds are meant for taking care of needy people in their constituencies and are utilised for various things like purchasing ambulances, making small roads and community centres.
""It (MPLAD) should not be suspended for two years. How did you presume that corona will go on for two years? Even if you had to do it you should have reduced it by half to Rs 2.5 crore. My suggestion to the government will be to reduce it to one year and in that one year Rs 2.5 crore fund be kept,"" he said.
Similarly, Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP), V Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP), K Somaprasad (CPI-M), Fauzia Khan (NCP), Veer Singh (BSP), Nazir Ahmed Laway (PDP) while supporting the reduction in salaries, sought restoration of the MPLAD scheme.
Wilson said the Centre is suspending MPLAD scheme when various infrastructure projects like Central Vista project were still being taken up.
Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD), while supporting the bill to cut salaries, asked the government to set it priorities properly. He asked if construction of a new Parliament building was necessary when the country was going through a tough phase.
Ram Chandra Prasad Singh (JD-U) sought creation of a special corpus to deal with pandemics in the future.
Earlier, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh allowed joint debate on both bills after members of the Upper House, cutting across party lines, suggested that as the contents and purpose of both bills were same, they should be discussed jointly.
Initiating the debate, Rajiv Satav (Cong) welcomed the step towards MPs' salary cuts but questioned the government's move to suspend the MPLAD scheme. ""You are talking about the common people and have suspended MPLAD scheme, which was meant for the welfare of people,"" he said.
Satav said government effort's to tackle the pandemic are a ""live example of mismanagement and failure"" and no chief ministers were consulted before the lockdown.
""In 2014, the GDP growth rate was 7.4 per cent and now it has come to a minus 23.9 per cent,"" he said, adding, ""Instead of being corona free, the country has become employment free (Corona mukt ke jagah Rojgar Mukt ho gaya)"".
Pointing at the PM CARES fund, Satav said ""no one knows to whom it is caring"".
He also pointed out expenses by the government during the pandemic on projects such as Central Vista, Bullet train and a special Rs 850 crore aircraft for the PM.
Shwait Mallik (BJP) said previous governments had not worked on disaster management. He said all states were consulted by the Centre while imposing the lockdown and PM had considered their suggestions.
Trinamool Congress member Dinesh Trivedi said the bill for reduction of members' salaries was decided only by some MPs on whatsapp.
A Vijayakumar of AIDMK welcomed both the bills and said the government should clear the arrears of some ongoing projects under MPLAD.
Prasanna Acharya (BJD) said MPLAD should not be suspended and all arrears of previous projects be cleared.","Rajya Sabha passes bills for reduction of MPs, ministers' salaries, opposition demands restoration of MPLAD | India News - Times of India",9,2020

As New Delhi is now being remade with a new Parliament and Central Vista, he shares his concerns with Amulya Gopalakrishnan
What are your thoughts about the new Parliament design, what does it signify?
An undertaking of this scale, complexity and sensitivity is rightly accountable to multiple constituencies: politicians in a hurry, for sure; but also architectural peers, scrutineers of public finances, urbanists and historians, and above all, the citizenry, current and future. We haven't seen even a minimal show of accountability.
I'm concerned about several aspects of the project: the integrity and vision of the architectural design; the process of specifying the brief and selecting the architect; the symbolic dimensions of the project, which after all is nothing less than a remaking of the agora of India's democracy; the functionality of the buildings; and more indeterminately but also most crucially, the future effects of such a project.
What about the overhaul of Central Vista? Why did newly democratic India keep this imperial space as it was?
Democracy is both an idea and a set of practices embodied in social life and public spaces. Certain spaces acquire, over time, a patina "" an aura, even "" of democratic struggles and aspirations. These spaces become symbolic anchors of that democracy. New Delhi's Central Vista is exactly such an environ.
Although it was designed originally to project an empire, the non-violent freedom fighters who dismantled that empire proceeded to reinvent the infrastructure of imperial control, turning it into the birthplace and jousting ground of India's experiment with democracy.
As such, Central Vista commemorates the recapture by Indians of their own history and destiny.
Its accretions and additions over time narrate a fitful story of Indian democracy. They are at once purposeful buildings and evocations of their historical moments of construction.
For a useful parallel, consider the Mall in Washington DC, that great public promenade of American democracy, where the ethos has been one of complication instead of erasure. Among the recent constructions that suggest a more expansive conception of America is the National Museum of African American History and Culture "" a building of immense intelligence. Equally striking, a museum dedicated to America's native populations stands squarely in the centre of things. What's underway on our Central Vista could not be more distant from such an approach. It echoes, instead, the ambitions of a Ceausescu, who eviscerated the historical heart of his capital city and left behind sterile towers of power.
Cities, like nations, are works in progress. The mistake is to think that one can return to some tabula rasa "" the myth of the original citizens, or of empty ground on which to build anew. It is more like Theseus's ship "" needing rebuilding while still sailing at sea.
The government claims that its re-election is mandate enough to redesign Delhi. What does this say about democracy?
This project portends a significant and probably irreversible alteration of the character of our capital city "" one that will endure beyond election cycles. As such, it merits the deepest scrutiny, public deliberation, and assessment. It's quite astonishing that something of this significance has been frogMared along so hastily. For instance, the architect was appointed without an open competition or any public consideration of alternative plans "" highly unusual for projects of this size and stature. In a way, the process here feels to me like a retread of old imperial ways "" appointment by despotic fiat. It's not just undemocratic; it's anti-democratic.
There have been other big architectural decisions. After the Hall of Nations in Pragati Maidan, Louis Kahn's IIMA building faced the wrecking ball. Why are these modernist buildings so unloved today?
Granted, buildings have a finite life, and not every one of them can and should be conserved. But when we have the knowledge and means to conserve buildings of national and world architectural importance, as well as the expertise to make them suitable for contemporary use, to demolish them without public debate and historical evaluation is nothing less than a scandal. This particular case makes plain an animus against the modernist era "" seen exclusively as an 'imposition' on India. That view is ignorant of the creativity with which Indians themselves engaged with modernist ideas and practices, and the global significance of that Indian modernist inventiveness "" think of B V Doshi or Charles Correa, for starters. The current anti-modernism effaces our history and heritage as well. But modernist buildings are not the only architectural targets, obviously. So too, as we know, are sixteenth-century mosques.
What is New India's signature look and building philosophy?
My hope is that no look or building philosophy will predominate, unless that spirit embodies a commitment to pluralism and architectural experimentation, and resists pomposity and grandiosity.","Central Vista is a symbol of Indians recapturing their history and destiny, says Sunil Khilnani - Times of India",1,2021

First, it was National War Memorial that came up amid some controversy and secrecy, which kept parts of the India Gate lawns off bounds for the people during its construction.
Then came some ugly Delhi Police barricades that were put up due to security concerns"" after the memorial opened. Now, ugly signboards with embarrassingly inaccurate spellings have been installed around the area by the traffic police, ignoring the aesthetics of the heritage zone.

Most of these are flex signage indicating 'entry' and 'exit' points. Some tell you how to enter and exit 'Shanjhan Road' (Shahjahan Road); another is a huge, fallen signboard that points you away from Amar Jawan Jyoti and the National War Memorial. These boards are an eyesore and jarring to the senses. Vivek Vihar resident Dhiraj Kumar thinks so.

He came with his five-year-old daughter on Saturday and felt the disconnect immediately. For every Delhiite, India Gate is a place of grandeur and a place for family outings. So many memories are associated with this place. These boards feel very out of place here. Maybe they could have used better material. Or guided people about entering and exiting in some other way,"" said the 35-year-old.
Nandita Aich, a young visitor from Kolkata, was aghast. Aren't there any norms for signage for heritage sites? I am trying to capture India Gate in one frame but look at these ugly signboards that are intruding,'"" she said in exasperation. You see this only at rallies.""
The traffic police say that they consulted the civic agencies before going ahead. The purpose of these is crowd control. These were set up after the major ruckus at India Gate on Jan 1 last year. The boards are temporary and can be removed when the purpose is served,"" said a traffic police officer.
Experts are not convinced. Dr Swapna Liddle, convenor of the Delhi Chapter of Intach, said there's now a huge gap between what the builders of Lutyens' Delhi had in mind when they designed the place and how the security agencies use it today. It was an open space where people just lounged around and had picnics. It had minimal police deployment earlier. After the war memorial, deployment has increased. All these systems were put in place from the security point of view,"" Liddle said.
According to her, National War Memorial is a prime example of a design and usage gap. The main gate of the memorial is from the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium end. But it is never open. There are multiple gates which are not operational. When a signage is designed, it is done as part of the original plan. This was an afterthought for a security purpose, an ad-hoc police requirement which was not systematically planned for,"" said Liddle who is also a historian of Delhi.
Urban planner and conservation consultant A G K Menon thinks the common man is no longer considered when grand plans are made. You can see that in this whole drive behind revamping Central Vista. They are not considering convenience of the people at all. This has always been a public space, designed to be used by people.

This is the location where a new Prime Minister's residence has been proposed. DDA has also approved the change for six other plots spread over 86 acres in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone.
The approvals include the change of land use from public and semi-public to government offices for plots where Vigyan Bhavan, National Archives and Raksha Bhavan are located. The land use for a 9.5-acre plot has been changed from recreational to Parliament House.
The changes were put in the public domain for 30 days and a board of inquiry will now take up the suggestions and objections, following which the Union housing and urban affairs ministry will come up with the final notifications.

Besides the outcome of the petition in the SC, the EAC has listed conditions including no cutting of trees, strict adherence to management of construction waste and enough provision for green space for the Rs 922 crore project.
According to the proceeding of the EAC meeting that took place between Apr 22 and 24, the CPWD rejected concerns over the government taking up the project during the Covid-19 emergency.

The coaches are expected to be smaller than the ones in conventional metro trains meant for mass transit, sources said.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will provide technical assistance for constructing the loop corridor and connecting it with the existing Central Secretariat Metro station at the concourse level. The underground project will be completely secured and access-controlled as it is primarily meant for the movement of thousands of government employees in the area.
Sources said as there will be a shuttle service connecting the area with the metro network, initially not more than two coaches will be required. Although the technology to be used is yet to be finalised, they added that the system is likely to be similar to the people mover at Singapore's Changi Airport.
Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and DMRC signed an MoU on Feb 28, according to which the latter will provide technical assistance and execute finishing and services works for the construction of the loop corridor.
The corridor will connect four Central Secretariat buildings with Central Secretariat station. The station is one of the major interchange hubs of the metro network, where the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-Huda City Centre) connects with the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh, Ballabhgarh).
The corridor has been proposed to cater to office-goers who travel to the government offices using the metro. The planning is being done anticipating a peak hour demand of 20,000 passengers per hour during the morning and evening peak hours. Sources said the frequency of services will be the highest for those hours as the footfall during off-peak hours is expected to be low.
As per the MoU, DMRC will prepare the detailed project report for the corridor, apart from finalising the horizontal and vertical alignment of the tracks and tunnels, along with sizing of facilities like platforms, support seervices and maintenance facilities. DMRC had said it will also appoint the detailed design consultant for the project.
While CPWD will carry out the basic civil structure construction work, DMRC will execute the design and construction of control systems, signal systems, track work, rolling stock (train sets), electrical and maintenance works.
Sources said that the metro loop corridor will be constructed in sync with the Central Vista redevelopment project. The Central Secretariat metro station, which has been in operation for more than 15 years, is likely to see a revamp too.
The Central Vista redevelopment project has been envisaged by integrating the concept of transit-oriented development, officials said. The connectivity of the loop corridor with NCR, thanks to the Central Secretariat metro station, is expected to significantly reduce the need to use private vehicles to reach offices in the area.
Apart from the Delhi Metro network, office-goers will also be able to use bus services available at the ground level, above the Central Secretariat metro station.",Small wonder: Why Delhi Metro's loop corridor will have 2-coach trains | Delhi News - Times of India,3,2022

Sources said the value of all construction and allied works could be around Rs 10,000 crore and the government has set Mar 2024 as the deadline for completing all projects, two months before the next general elections.

The firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management (P) Ltd, which has designed several projects in India and abroad, including the redevelopment of Ahmedabad's Sabarmati riverfront, bagged the contract on technical and financial parameters ahead of three other firms.
HCP director Bimal Patel told TOI that his firm had done some work"" in the BJP headquarter project in Delhi.
Patel said HCP will complete the task of preparing a plan in six months. The government will subsequently bid out the civil construction works.
The idea behind the revamp, apart from better utilisation of the area and getting rid of some of the ageing and crowded buildings, is to create a modern architecture more associated with independent India, as a succession from the Lutyens' era masonry around Vijay Chowk.
Urban affairs ministry officials said HCP scored high on technical parameters though it had quoted the second lowest amount in its financial bid. While HCP quoted Rs 229 crore, runner-up C P Kukreja Architects had pitched its bid at Rs 218 crore.
Housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the competition was close"" among all four short-listed bidders and a jury of experts chose the firm that scored the highest. Since the project management contract is primarily for design, 80% weightage was given to quality and 20% to costs.
Puri said there is no question of razing any heritage structure. All history and culture will be preserved while undertaking the revamp project. I assure you that North Block, South Block and Parliament House will remain as they are but their use may change... The project will be implemented under the direct control and supervision of the government. The selected firm will hold public consultation with all stakeholders,"" he said.
Housing secretary Durga Shankar Misra said inputs and suggestions from all other architecture firms who made it to the final list would be incorporated since this of national importance. He said, I have held meetings with two of the bidders and went through their presentation. I will go through the presentations of other four on Monday. This is a big opportunity to have the best world class facilities.""
Responding to a question whether HCP had the experience in designing the development plan involving heritage areas, Puri said, Heritage experts would be brought in when the project is implemented. Domain experts and architects would be hired as associates to implement this project."" Patel said experts will be involved and their firm was the project management consultant for redevelopment of the temple complex in Varanasi.
HCP has been tasked with preparing a site survey plan, executing a geo-technical survey and feasibility study, developing a new master plan and devising a strategy to execute the work besides designing building plans. It will also be responsible for obtaining statutory approvals, preparing landscape plans, designing all services and amenities and traffic integration plan.

There is talk of the Parliament and North and South Blocks not being structurally safe. They can't be retrofitted and hence will be converted into museums. But if the buildings are unsafe for MPs, how can they be safe for the common man?"" asked Manchanda.

While officials refused to comment on PM's residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg after the revamp of Central Vista, sources said the government may continue to keep both the residential complexes earmarked for the PM. They added that the design of the project is still in the works and nothing has been finalised. TOI had on Nov 3 reported on the plan to bring PM's residence closer to South Block.
Sources said as per the plan, IGNCA will come up on around 15 acre land near Jamnagar House and the government has told the architect and design planner to ensure state-of-the-art facilities at the new IGNCA which will also have a National Centre for Performing Arts.

The firm, which will be paid Rs 229.75 crore for consultancy services, will prepare the master plan of the project, including designs, cost estimation, landscape and traffic integration plans, and parking facilities among others, he said at a press conference.
HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, based in Ahmedabad, is led by architect Bimal Patel and has developed several projects, including the Sabarmati Riverfront Development where Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a mammoth event to celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.
It has also developed the Central Vista at Gandhinagar and the Mumbai Port Complex.
On the cost of the project, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said usually, the consultation fee is around three per cent of the total project cost.
However, sources in the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) said the project cost may increase due to different aspects.
The development or redevelopment of Parliament will be done by Aug 2022 when India celebrates its 75th Independence Day. By next year, the Central Vista will be redeveloped and the common Central Secretariat will be built by 2024, as per plan.
Puri, who was accompanied by ministry secretary Durga Shanker Mishra and CPWD director general Prabhakar Singh, said a total of six bids were received, and HCP Design's selection was made by a six-member jury led by director of the School of Planning and Architecture P S N Rao.
The minister, however, made it clear that the facade of the 90-year-old Parliament building, and North and South blocks, which are heritage buildings, will not be touched while redeveloping the Central Vista, an over 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.
To facilitate the new Common Central Secretariat, several buildings such as the Shastri Bhawan, the Nirman Bhawan, the Krishi Bhawan and the Udyog Bhawan may be razed.The government has not taken a decision on it yet.
""It's a very a major project which will be executed on mission-mode... the time has now come to build modern, world-class, energy-efficient buildings which will be defining the characteristic of Delhi as a leading world capital for the next 200 years,"" Puri told reporters.
He said that the revamp project will use the best technology to make Delhi a world-class city.
The minister said the government will go through public consultations till the tendering process for selecting a contractor is complete.
It will also engage various stakeholders such as heritage experts, urban and traffic specialists while executing the ambitious project of the Modi government, Puri said.
""At present, our government offices are strewn all over Delhi... We want all essential government offices at one place,"" Puri said, adding that the new buildings will be energy efficient and modern work places.
Besides HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, five other firms -- CP Kukreja Architects, Sikka Associates Architects, INI Design Studio, Arcop Associates Pvt Ltd and Architect Haffez Contractor -- participated in the bidding process.
The ministry secretary said on Monday, he will call a meeting with those architecture firms which could not win consultancy bid and will get suggestions from them.
On his part, CPWD director general Prabhakar Singh said while choosing the architecture firm, 80 per cent weightage was given to quality aspect and 20 per cent to financial aspects.
The buildings on Raisina Hills were constructed from 1911 to 1931 and designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, he said, adding that at that time, all these were designed to have offices for the viceroy and the secretariat.
The Parliament building was constructed in the same period. Various building along Rajpath have been constructed at different stages for accommodating offices of various central government ministries and departments, Singh said.

While announcing the name of the selected urban design firm, Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the facade of North and South Blocks wouldn't be touched and the existing Parliament House wouldn't be demolished.
HCP has suggested that the new Parliament can come up close to the existing one. In fact, even the Lok Sabha secretariat had indicated this while seeking suggestions from sitting MPs for either renovation of the existing Parliament building or construction of altogether a new Parliament building within the given premises"".
Sources said there is enough space to build a new structure behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, which faces the present Parliament building. Currently, this space is used for parking. They added that while the existing parliament has huge open space, the new one could have more built-up area to accommodate the possibility of more MPs after fresh delimitation.
Urban affairs ministry officials said the conceptual plan of HCP was selected considering that the entire proposal was not flashy and was close to the government's requirement. They added that the current height restrictions in the Lutyens' area at 26 to 32 meters would be maintained while sealing the redevelopment plan. Some of the buildings may be razed and even a new Central Conference Centre may come up. Currently, Vigyan Bhawan is used for conferences.
The overall plan is to ensure that there will be no on-ground parking across the area and there will be adequate underground parking space to meet the requirement. There could be a low-speed circular rail type facility that can connect all the office buildings that form part of the Central Secretariat,"" said a source.

The CPWD recently presented the cost details and work-in-progress details of the project to a five-member panel which has been constituted by the government for monitoring the pace of all works under the mega Central Vista redevelopment project, they added.
The new Parliament Building project was awarded to Tata Projects at Rs 971 crore and 40% of the work is now complete. The government set Oct 2022 as the deadline so that the winter session can be held in the new building.
While a spokesperson of the project consultant, HCP Design, Planning and Management, said the CPWD or the housing and urban affairs ministry was better suited to answer the questions about cost escalation, neither of the government agencies responded to TOI's queries. Questions sent to the Lok Sabha secretary general were also not answered.
Sources said while the project was planned to meet the requirements of safe structure in areas falling under seismic zone-IV, later it was felt that for increasing the lifespan of the building it should meet the requirements of structures built on areas falling under seismic zone-V. Though Delhi falls under zone-IV, the structures have been strengthened to comply with the norms for buildings in zone-V. This has resulted in an increase in the cost to some extent,"" said an official.
Also, the connectivity through the tunnel from the proposed Prime Minister's residence and similar connectivity to the proposed chambers of MPs have also resulted in an increase in cost. This was not factored in the original estimate.
Besides, fresh provisions have been made also for a modern audio-visual system to be installed in both Houses of Parliament, meeting rooms and chambers of ministers, leading to an increase in cost.
Compliance with the directives of Supreme Court also contributed to the hike in construction cost. Citing an example, an official said all the earth excavated from the project site has been transported to the proposed Eco Park in Badarpur, though as per the bid condition, the contractor was allowed to sell the excavated earth.","Delhi: Cost of new Parliament building rises 24% to Rs 1,200 crore | Delhi News - Times of India",1,2022

Sharma said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed glaring shortcomings in India's public healthcare system and a ""flawed"" insurance-linked private hospital over-dependence.

The Narendra Modi government has readied a blue print for its ambitious plan to redevelop Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor in Delhi "" for which several buildings such as Krishi Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President's residence and Nirman Bhawan are likely to be razed.
The redevelopment plan of Central Vista is likely to include a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common central secretariat for ministries and the revamping of the 3km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate.
Shifting the residences of the vice-president and the prime minister close to the Rashtrapati Bhavan is also under consideration. An official said the 2022 Republic Day parade would take place at the ""modernised"" Rajpath.
As part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, the government will construct a central secretariat to accommodate offices of all ministries, the cabinet secretary said in the letter.

The mega plan will explore options that include constructing a new Parliament building close to the present one or modernising the existing building to meet future needs; constructing a common central secretariat to accommodate most departments and upgrading the central vista to make it a major tourist attraction.
The Central Public Works Department has invited bids from firms and consultants to prepare a new master plan for the entire central vista that represents the values and aspirations of a New India "" good governance, efficiency, transparency, accountability and equity, and is rooted in Indian culture and social milieu"".

The plan includes upgrading the public facilities, amenities, parking and green space. Officials said the existing Parliament building may not have enough space to accommodate more MPs when fresh delimitation of constituencies is done.
The government has set a 2024 deadline for completing all projects, which would perhaps be one of the most hectic construction exercises in the area in nearly a century. Iconic buildings including Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, North and South Blocks were built between 1911 and 1931 after architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker had planned the central vista.
Once the new secretariat becomes operational, the government can shift offices from South and North Blocks and may even consider turning these buildings into museums, sources said.
The housing and urban affairs ministry is responsible for maintenance and development of the central vista and its surrounding areas.
The selected firm will prepare a plan that will entail concept, detailed design and strategies development/redevelopment works, refurbishment works, demolition of existing buildings as well as related infrastructure and site development.
The CPWD document says that the new iconic structures"" built in the central vista shall be a legacy for 150 to 200 years at the very least.
Sources said the firm will give options for new development only in the area that falls under the central vista zone, indicating the government's focus on efficient use of the land parcels. The bid document for engaging a consultant also says many of the buildings in this area are over 40-50 years old and have either outlived, or are approaching, their structural lives. Moreover, certain plots in this area are in the form of hutments since Independence and are under-utilised. These hutments occupy an area of over 90 acres and house either defence establishments or government offices, the document said.
The consultant would suggest whether these can be razed and huge chunks of land freed for constructing a mega Central Secretariat. The present secretariat is spread over 47 buildings and nearly 70,000 employees work there. Though the government had first mooted a plan to build a massive new secretariat spread over nearly 10 acres in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone in Nov 2014 (TOI had first reported it), it later nixed the idea. The plan has been revived and expanded.
An official said the plan is justified considering that the government was spending about Rs 1,000 crore annually as rent for government offices in private properties.

""The word 'Rajpath' sounds as the idea of ruling over others but now 'Kartavya Path' inspires us to fulfill our duties towards nation, society, family and all people without any discrimination.

The PM also inaugurated the newly revamped Central Vista, which has Kartavya Path as its axis and runs east-west from the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hill.

The popular congregation green spot for Delhiites has been given a new look with sandstone fixtures, public amenities and upgraded street furniture.
While most of the buildings, including Parliament House and colonial bungalows, around Rajpath were designed by British architect Edwin Lutyens and his associate architect Herbert Baker during the creation of a new capital of British India, much of the space will now be taken up by the construction of new ministerial buildings. Parliament is also getting a new house.

During British rule in the early decades of the 20th century, the boulevard was called Kingsway in honour of King George V, who visited the city for the Delhi Durbar of 1911 when it was proclaimed the capital in place of Calcutta. The name Kingsway was apparently picked up from the custom-built arterial road in London, which was inaugurated by George V's father, King Edward VII in 1905.
After India's independence in 1947, the central vista from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate and beyond it, the 16th century Purana Qila was chosen as the 'heart' of Delhi and renamed Rajpath. The road was given its Hindi name of Rajpath, which was not quite a literal but an analogous translation of its earlier name.
The British architects' vision was a city on the lines of other great capitals of the world, with broad, long avenues flanked by sprawling lawns, impressive monuments punctuating the avenue, the symbolic seat of power looming at the terminal point. They found the perfect geographical location for a new city on Raisina Hill, west of Purana Qila. The new capital was developed on a geometric design, mainly employing hexagons and triangles and had as its core the Central Vista.

New Delhi Municipal Council in a special meeting on Wednesday passed the resolution for renaming Rajpath and Central Vista lawns as Kartavya Path"".

The centrepiece of this new capital was the Raisina Hill complex, housing the majestic Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) and North Block and South Block forming the Imperial Secretariat.
A grand axis was laid from the Great Place (later renamed to Vijay Chowk) to India Gate by the architects with verdant lawns, fountains and ornamental lampposts on both sides, forming the resplendent Central Vista Avenue.
Baker created a circular Parliament House near the Rashtrapati Bhavan which was inaugurated by the then Viceroy Lord Irwin in Jan 1927.
The city, constructed between the two World Wars and which took over 20 years to build, was inaugurated on Feb 13, 1931 by the same viceroy.
On India's Independence on Aug 15, 1947, the boulevard from Raisina Hill to India Gate was chock-a-block with people, welcoming the dawn of a free India which shook off the yoke of a long colonial rule.
India then became a Republic on Jan 26, 1950, and Rajpath has been the venue of all Republic Day celebrations since 1951.
Only the first Republic Day celebrations was held at Irwin Stadium (now Captain Dhyan Chand National Stadium) behind India Gate complex, where the Rajpath stretch ends.
The Rajpath and the Central Vista lawns flanking the promenade were officially renamed as Kartavya Path, as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) approved the renaming and issued a public notice in this regard on Wednesday.
Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi, who is also a member of the NDMC, on Wednesday said that Rajpath was known as Kingsway during the British rule, while Janpath was known as Queensway.
""However, after 75 years of independence, it is felt that the name of Rajpath needs to be changed, in tune with the values and principles of democracy and a contemporary, new India. The Kartavya Path will also inspire everyone who visit or cross the road to perform their duties towards the country, the society and their families,"" she said.
NDMC Vice Chairman Satish Upadhyay said the proposal was received from the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
On Thursday, Modi will also unveil the 28-ft statue of Bose at India Gate, housed in its ornamental canopy.

Modi said that if Netaji's statue has replaced the statue of George V, it is due to the ""shedding of our mindset of slavery"".

Kartavya Path reflects the ideals of our nation since time immemorial and that of a new India, which we need to make the greatest nation on the earth.""

""Some things are the same and some things have changed. But I feel the revamp was overdue. The place has a fresh appeal for the youth. I used to come here with my wife after marriage.

A senior Culture Ministry official said people are thronging the India Gate area and the 'Kartavya Path'. Two step-amphitheatres and four stages have been set up on this road where cultural performances are being hosted.
Sources said the events will now be a bit subdued due to the state mourning to be observed on Sep 11 following the death of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II.
Shahzad Khan, 19, a Jharkhand native who recently moved to Noida, was also among the visitors who enjoyed the first day after the opening of the India Gate complex.

""It is our pride, our heritage, and we all must respect it while enjoying it,"" he said, as he took a brisk walk to see the granite statue of Bose.

The new building is being constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project and it is expected to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction work.

On Feb 4 this year, the Bhoomi Poojan ceremony of Central Vista Avenue was performed by then Union Minister of State with Independent charge Hardeep S Puri and other senior officers of the Ministry at India Gate, New Delhi.
With this ceremony, the work started for the development/ redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue.
The redevelopment project of Central Vista envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate

According to the plan, the new Parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs, will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating 'paperless offices'.

The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.
The Government approved a proposal for the development of Central Vista Avenue with an estimated cost of Rs 608 crores on Nov 10, 2020. Requisite permissions from Delhi Urban Arts Commission, Heritage Conservation Committee, Central Vista Committee, Local Body etc. have been obtained.

Following a months-long exercise, Delhi government's transport department has finally awarded the contract to Omaxe group to provide seamless service between Jain Temple and Fatehpuri Masjid along the revamped central vista of Chandni Chowk. Sources said the modalities were being worked out and the agreement may soon be signed to start the service.
To decongest the road and allow free movement to pedestrians, Delhi government barred the movement of motor vehicles on both carriageways of the 1.3-km stretch of Chandni Chowk's central vista from 9am to 9pm on all days. Though e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are allowed to operate, 11 battery-run golf carts would be run to give a memorable experience to visitors. The service would be free and priority would be given to the elderly, differently abled, women and children.
The electric golf carts would have a vintage"" look to suit the overall aesthetics and heritage environment of Chandni Chowk. The agency would have to first take approval from Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation on the design and colour scheme of the carts before they are procured. Apart from the driver, the carts would accommodate seven passengers. They would have uniformed drivers and be allowed to pick up and drop passengers only at designated stops.
Officials said later the number of carts may be increased to 22, including two spare ones. Initially, the golf carts would be run on the main Chandni Chowk road, but their operation may be extended to adjoining roads too. They would only be battery-operated and use of no other fuel would be allowed. Similar carts are deployed near the Taj Mahal complex in Agra for ferrying tourists and the service is quite popular.
The initial duration of the contract is three years, which can be extended later. The carts will be charged at the multilevel parking-cum-commercial project developed by Omaxe in Chandni Chowk. Since these are electric golf carts, our endeavour is to join the government in promoting clean energy and fight air pollution,"" said a spokesperson of Omaxe group, adding that an ecosystem was being created where parking, charging points and driver lounge would be provided at the multilevel parking lot.

According to the Central Vista redevelopment plan, a new PM House and PMO will come up on the South Block side and the new VP's residence would be on the North Block side. The MPs' chambers will come up where the Transport and Shram Shakti Bhawans are currently located, just across Parliament.

TOI has learnt that the lawns along Rajpath had only 454 trees in 1930 and there was symmetry. But later the number of trees increased as different types of trees were planted without any planning and keeping in mind the original intent when the Central Vista Avenue was planned.
Government sources said a few round of deliberations have happened with experts and organisations specialising in this field. The work for redevelopment of Rajpath and beautification of the lawns has started and is scheduled for completion by this year-end.
The government has also prepared a detailed plan to build nine modern office buildings and central conference centre along the Rajpath as a part of the ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.

Sources said that the special cell had received a tip-off about the presence of some suspicious men in Old Seemapuri on Thursday morning. The informer's tip suggested that the suspects may be connected to the recovery of the Ghazipur IED.
""A fully equipped team led by DCP Pramod Kushwaha and comprising ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan rushed to the spot,"" a senior officer said.
The building was vacated even as a team went in armed with MP-5 submachine guns and Glocks. However, the flat located on the second floor was empty with a bag lying inside.

X-ray and other tests were conducted, which confirmed explosives. The initial examination also suggested presence of ammonium nitrate. The bag was then destroyed in a controlled explosion inside a ditch dug up for this purpose.
The owner of the flat, Ashim, told cops that he lived in Ghaziabad and had let out the flat to a tenant through a property dealer a few weeks ago. Ten days ago, three others were seen along with the tenant, who supposedly fled on Thursday morning.

Some projects requiring such help are the Central Vista development and the Dwarka Expressway.
A forest official disclosed, We have received 40 proposals from construction companies for transplanting trees, nine in the central division, 12 in the south and 19 in the west. Many projects were given approval for transplantation a few months ago but the construction companies were awaiting the empanelment of technical experts. With the panels recently finalised, the project developers can now choose an agency for the work.

For Dwarka Expressway project, officials revealed that nearly 12,000 trees have already been transplanted and their survival rate was around 84%. They said around 1,000 more remained to be moved. The forest department has also granted permission to Delhi Jal Board to carry out some transplantation in the west division.
Among the other projects that will have to undertake tree transplantation include the Netaji Nagar Redevelopment Project, where Delhi government recently gave permission to transplant 1,314 trees. Over 1,800 trees are also expected to be transplanted for the Central Vista project.

Similarly, for Delhi Urban Extension Road (UER) 2, there is an application pending for the shifting of around 2,000 trees.""
The official said it was mandatory for each construction project to disclose at the start the number of trees to be affected. This figure, once provided, is assessed and once cleared by Delhi government, the transplantation of the affected trees can be carried out. This figure can increase or decrease, depending on the tree species and their chances of survival. Invasive species, however, are not transplanted at all.""
The tree transplantation policy was notified last year. It says a minimum of 80% of trees affected by a development or construction project have to be transplanted and as many as 80% of them must survive the transplantation. Additionally, compensatory planting of 10 saplings for each tree will continue.
The official added, The trees should be properly preserved and none should be unnecessarily removed for the development projects. When on-site preservation is not possible, scientific transplantation of the affected trees, rather than their felling, has to become the new norm.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi

The 6.5-meter state emblem of India, weighing 16,000 kg, fully hand crafted by Indian artisans, is made of high purity bronze. There is no other similar depiction of the emblem, from the perspective of material and craftsmanship, anywhere else in India, they said.
Over 100 artisans from various parts of the country tirelessly worked on the design, crafting and casting of the emblem for over six months to bring out the quality that could be seen in the final installation, the sources said.
A source said, The installation itself was a challenge as it was 32 metres above upper ground level. Giving wings to the ambition of creating such an expression of the state emblem needed dedication, meticulous supervision, and skilful installation "" all depicting various elements of Atmanirbhar Bharat. When it is seated at the top of the temple of our democracy "" the Parliament building, it truly represents the paradigm of 'for the people, by the people'.""
Regarding the process of casting of national emblem, government sources said a computer graphic sketch was made and based on that a clay model was created. Once approved by competent authorities the FPR Model was made. Then with the lost wax process the wax mould and bronze cast was done.

Attending the concluding ceremony of five-day Northern India Regional Agriculture Fair-2021 at SKUAST Jammu, the minister said, ""This is the golden period of agriculture in India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and technological interventions, research and innovation in agriculture under his leadership will double the farmers' income by 2022.""
Singh said that the PM's seriousness towards agriculture development in India can be judged from the fact that two new ministries, Jal Shakti and skill development & entrepreneurship, have specially been created to promote agriculture.
Singh said that agriculture and farm production has been revolutionised in India under the current government, which is evident from various initiatives taken for the welfare of farmers like the soil health card, neem-coated urea, PM Fasal Bima Yojana, PM Kissan Sammaan, e-Nam, etc. Enumerating the development initiatives taken in J&K vis-�-vis agriculture and innovation, Singh said that the establishment of north India's first biotechnology park, two high-seed processing plants at Kathua, and launch of India's first Aroma Mission will open new vistas of growth, opportunities and innovation in agriculture in Jammu.
Speaking to farmers present on the occasion, Singh emphasized that a farmer can now engage in multiple activities depending upon his capacity and resources. He maintained that the government is facilitating farmers in every way possible to achieve financial prosperity. The minister further said that the proactive outreach for start-ups is the need of the hour to get the best minds for promotion of products at national and international level.",Golden period of agriculture under PM Modi: MoS Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India,10,2021

As a result, new vistas of opportunities have opened up for the industry compared to sectors like hospitality, travel & tourism, garments, and textiles, which are struggling to recover from the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, said Subrata Gupta, state food processing and horticulture secretary.
Addressing a session on developments and opportunities in food processing and the horticulture organized by industry body MCCI, Gupta stated that although West Bengal has immense potential to have a well developed food processing industry because of abundance of raw materials and the presence of six agro-climatic zones, yet it is severely restricted due to scattered markets.
In west Bengal, 2.8% of the cultivation is processed, while the national average is about 2.2%. However, in the process, the farmers suffer a loss of 27% because markets are often scattered. Most of these farmers are small farmers, who practise subsistence farming and therefore have little left for the market,"" he added.
In order to improve the durability and shelf life of harvests, the government has set up low-cost cold onion storages. We have also planned to set up a centralized common facility with the presence of a centralized cold room along with five-six small food processing units with where people can access the local producers and get the materials for processing. We are hopeful that the approval will come by Oct, following which, we will be able to set up these units by next year,"" he said.

The housing ministry is getting 100-120 metres ready, which is being seen as a move to dispel misinformation about the project of how this will mean loss of pristine trees and open public space.

Sources said after the complete redevelopment, the lawns will get approximately 15 km of walkways. High quality 60 mm granite stone is being used for these walkways. Different types of grass are being planted that can grow in the open and under the trees. The aeration system in canals will control algae.

On the issue of Rajpath lawns and trees, environmentalist Pradip Krishen told TOI, The lawns will remain and there will be more space for the public. There is a careful drainage plan to ensure there is no stagnant water in the lawns. The idea is to have less water demanding grass and trees. Now we have a decent tree plan for Central Vista Avenue. Around 26 jamun trees will be transplanted in this area. We can't say how many will survive, but some of them may survive because these are being transplanted in the project site where the nature of soil is similar.""
TOI on Mar 15 had first reported the Tree Master Plan"" for Rajpath lawns, which is also known as Central Vista Avenue, to ensure no more haphazard plantations on this stretch. The forest department of Delhi government has so far given permission for transplantation of six jamun trees.
Krishen, who authored 'Trees of Delhi', said that approximately 52 trees will be planted on these lawns of two species "" Pilkhan and Kosam "" that have red foliage. Sources said the draft Master Plan specifies the species of trees to be planted on these lawns as and when the existing trees die natural deaths and this would be realized after 20-30 years. These would include trees with coloured canopy. Once the plan is finalised, there will be strict compliance of the norms,"" said a source.
The environmentalist said the main lawn set far back, which is close to the proposed new office buildings, will get flowering trees such as Semul, Amaltas and Barna. The CPWD has also proposed options such as Dhak and Gulmohar.
On the issue of transplantation of trees from other sites to NTPC Badarpur and their chances of survival, Krishen said this seems bleak since there is no similarity in the soil type and till recently the new site was used for dumping fly ash.

Around 2kg of RDX explosive was packed in a solid iron casing, equipped with a commercial charge timer, and kept inside a black bag. Traces of ammonium nitrate were found on the surface of the device.
What has alarmed the intelligence agencies and the special cell is that explosives were discovered in Srinagar and Amritsar, simultaneously, indicating that a coordinated strike may have been attempted, potentially by ISI. While it was a pressure cooker IED in Srinagar, explosives and detonators were seized from a field in Amritsar.

The special cell has filed an FIR on the incident and begun a probe. Two primary lines of investigation are being followed: sleeper cells of a terror outfit being activated in the capital and involvement of Khalistani operatives. The latter stems from the recent alerts issued by various agencies.

In Delhi, police responded to a call of a suspicious object in a bag at Ghazipur around 10.20am. According to the control room log, the caller said that an unattended bag was kept near his scooter parked near Gate No. 1 of the flower market. The market is usually packed with people at this time.
Immediately, the control room dispatched bomb and dog squads. Simultaneously, an NSG bomb disposal squad - which is stationed at Central Vista at present - was rushed to the spot.
The area was cordoned off. The bag was picked up by a robot deployed by NSG and secured in a special wagon even as a JCB was brought to the spot to dig a hole for carrying out a controlled explosion to destroy the IED.
""The bomb disposal squad of NSG defused the IED recovered from Ghazipur. Samples of the IED have been collected and the team will submit a report on the chemical components used to assemble the explosive,"" said an NSG official.
By afternoon, the multi-agency centre, a nodal unit, received reports regarding recovery of explosives in Punjab and Srinagar as well. Intelligence agencies are tracking recent movements of terror modules for leads. ""The imprints show that the IED is similar to the ones recovered in Punjab recently. It is being probed if the IED is the one of the dozen devices smuggled from across the border last year. Only a few have been recovered from that consignment till now,"" said a source in an agency.
Two days ago, Punjab Police recovered 2.5kg of RDX, a detonator, five explosive fuses with wires and other weapons and ammunitions in Gurdaspur. Analysis of the bomb used in the blast at the Ludhiana court complex had revealed that 2kg of RDX was used.
Delhi Police's special cell has collected CCTV footage from the stretches adjoining the spot. No camera was found focused on the spot.

The statue, made of black granite from Telangana, will be placed under the canopy at India Gate, probably in Aug this year, TOI has learnt. Once installed, the grand statue will be clearly visible from Raisina Hill.
PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that he would unveil a hologram of Bose, Netaji to legions of his admirers, at the same place on his birthday on Jan 23 evening. Visitors will be able to see the hologram statue only at night.

Government sources termed the decision to honour Bose a move by India to reclaim its history"" as the canopy had once featured a statue of England's King George V, which was removed and shifted in 1968 to Coronation Park at Burari in Delhi.
The honour for Netaji is expected to go a long way to salve the hurt of his devotees who have been sore that the freedom fighter has been denied recognition due to him.
Significantly, the PM had hit out at the earlier Congress governments saying that leaders of previous dispensations constructed new things only for their families whereas his government is building monuments of national importance.
After Independence, new things were constructed only for a few families from Delhi. But today, the country is leaving behind that narrow thinking, building new places of pride, giving them grandeur. It is our government that built the Babasaheb Memorial in Delhi and the APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial in Rameswaram. Similarly, the places associated with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Shyamji Krishna Varma have been given grandeur. Adivasi museums are also being built across the country to bring forth the glo- rious history of our tribal society,"" said the PM.
Netaji's daughter Anita Bose Pfaff said that he lived, lives and will continue to live in the hearts of the Indian pe- ople. Welcoming the PM's announcement, Pfaff, who lives in Germany, said Netaji had a vision for the financial and economic strength of India and had set up a Planning Commission even before the country got its independence. She was speaking at a we- binar on Netaji organised by the Press Information Bureau, Jaipur.
What surprises me is it came all of a sudden now. One might have prepared a bit earlier, but better late than never, I must say. I hope that the controversy about the tableau can also be put to rest in a satisfactory manner,"" she said.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath - from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.
""Shifting the residences of the Vice President and the Prime Minister close to the North Block and the South Block, respectively, is being planned. This would also help in easing traffic in the area as VIP movements often cause inconvenience to the people in Lutyens' Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The two legislative chambers in the new parliament building will have a seating arrangement similar to the Maharashtra assembly, where rows would be separated from each other by seats for two to facilitate easier movement for MPs.
At present, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha chambers have longer rows. In the new chambers planned, a third person could be accommodated in case of a joint sitting of Houses. The new building is part of the mega central vista redevelopment plan.
Since the beginning, joint sittings of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been held in Parliament's Central Hall as neither chamber has the capacity to seat all MPs. The planned Lok Sabha chamber, however, will be able to accommodate up to 1,300 people, said a senior official involved in the planning.
At present, 8-10 MPs sit in a row. If one arrives late or leaves early, one has to cross several colleagues with much difficulty,"" the official said. The last two rows in the Lok Sabha were added later and there are seats behind the pillars. The pillars obstruct the view of the presiding officer. Overall it is a cramped House,"" the official said.
Even if the strength of the Lok Sabha is increased to match the population ratio, the planned chamber would have the capacity to seat the additional members. Though the bench would seat two MPs, it would have the effective space for a third person. This is why we plan not to have individual seats,"" the official said.
One of the major hurdles in redevelopment of central vista relates to demolition of buildings. According to a source, the National Archives will not be moved but the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, an autonomous institution under the culture ministry, would be shifted. The redevelopment plan of the central vista includes extension of the area till the banks of the Yamuna through a series of pedestrian walkways and cycle paths that would lead to a 'New India Garden', the design for which would be selected through competition. Though the urban affairs ministry has been silent about the project cost, estimates of the Central Public Works Department had pegged it at Rs 6,000 crore eight years back.

New Delhi: The bungalows of ministers, top officers of armed forces, seniormost judges and government officials could be demolished to make way for energy-and-space efficient modern houses. As the Centre takes up the ambitious project of redeveloping the Central Vista and constructing a new Parliament, it is planning to raze old bungalows of Lutyens' Delhi.
The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has resurrected a five-year-old proposal to completely redevelop the Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ). Bungalows built by the British between 1912 and 1930 are the main target of the plan.
CPWD director-general Prabhakar Singh told ET: All bungalows have outlived their lives. They have seepage and termite problems. The world over houses built by the British have been demolished because they are considered unsafe. We must give credit to CPWD for maintaining these bungalows so well.""

LBZ redevelopment plan has been in the offing since 1998 when the Centre formed a committee to examine the proposal. The then urban development ministry received a proposal to redevelop the Central Vista and further classify the heritage zones. Later, in 2014, government decided to start redevelopment of flats for members of Parliament. While redevelopment of a part of the zone was cleared, the Type VIII, or the most spacious, bungalows occupied by the top echelons of bureaucracy remained untouched.
We will again push our plan to redevelop the Lutyens Bungalow Zone. It would help in optimum utilisation of land and give better energy-and-space efficient modern houses to our ministers and officials. The success of redevelopment can be seen in Sunehri Bagh, North and South Avenues and BD Marg flats,"" Singh said.
CPWD would place its plan once again before the housing and urban affairs ministry. The plan would require clearances from the Delhi Urban Arts Commission and Central Vista Committee.
The area of about 26 square kilometre extends from Raisina Hills, housing President of India, North and South Blocks, to residential colonies like Golf Links, Chanakyapuri, Sardar Patel Marg and Panchsheel Marg.
What has given an added fillip to the plan is the central plan to redevelop Central Vista. A senior official said: When we are opening up the area for such massive construction, the most obvious thing is to build new homes for top bureaucrats and ministers. We will save space and maintenance cost and there will be better houses.""",Government may raze old bungalows to redevelop Lutyens' Delhi | India News - Times of India,11,2019

The bill replaces the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 which was promulgated by President Ram Nath Kovind on Dec 30, 2020 to extend the validity of the act of 2011 for a period of three years from Jan 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2023.
""1.35 crore people of Delhi, those living in unauthorised colonies, will get their ownership right,"" Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said in Rajya Sabha.
The bill provides protection to certain forms of unauthorised developments in Delhi from punitive action where adequate measures are yet to be taken.
Puri said that tenders have been floated for ""Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan"".

""Delhi will not only benefit from the improvement in living conditions of 1.35 crore people but the Central Vista project will also make Delhi one of the finest cities in the world,"" Puri said.
The minister said that the number of 1.35 crore is expected in the next census later this year.
CPI (M) MP Bikash Ranjan said, ""Is it an ordinance raj that we are living in? The bill has such a laudable purpose but it has not been executed. Why has it not been executed within time is not explained. The ordinance was brought in just a day before the terminal period of the earlier bill. Repeatedly extension through ordinance is condemnable.""
Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh said that as informed in the house 40 lakh people live in slums.
He said that the government had promised last year that people in unauthorised colonies will be given ownership rights and demanded that it should be executed now.
Before moving the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Puri said the government would have brought a law had there been a Winter Session of Parliament.
""The urgency was that if we had not enacted in the interim period, the process of sealing, demolition, etc would have started. I am sure no member of this House would like Delhi to be subjected to that kind of uncertainty and chaos,"" he said.
The bill aims to extend the validity of NCT Delhi special provisions for three years from Jan 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2023, he added.
The minister shared that in 2006, Parliament had enacted Delhi laws special provisions Act to protect certain forms of encroachment and unauthorised development from punitive action namely demolition, sealing and displacement etc.
""These provisions were on previous occasion extended through various ordinances and acts in 2007, 2009, 2014 and 2017,"" he said.
Stating that there has been a sharp rise in population in Delhi from 8 lakh in 1947 to 1.6 crore in 2011, the minister said, ""Exponential growth has led to serious stretch on resources leading to vast gaps in demand and supply.""
However, the government has followed a three-pronged approach to address the urbanisation needs of Delhi through three schemes that will benefit a total of 1.35 crore citizens, he said.
About 50 lakh people are expected to benefit from the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY), 10 lakh people from Jaha Jhuggi Wahi Makan' under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and 75 lakh people from land pooling which are under various stages of implementation, he added.
Highlighting the progress made under these schemes, the minister said the PM-UDAY was launched at end of 2019. ""Inspite of the fact that we lost one year due to the pandemic, I am happy to inform that 3,82,499 registrations have been done. Authorisation and conveyance receipts have been issued to 4,035 households.""
Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has also finalised controlled norms which are expected to trigger redevelopment in these colonies, he said, adding that JJ clusters in Kalkaji Extension, Jallianwala Bagh and Kathputli colony are are in advanced stages of completion
Participating in the debate, CPI leader Binay Viswam expressed concern over the ordinance route being adopted by the government bypassing Parliament and taking away people's right.
He requested the Chair to give ""strict instruction"" to the government to not make ordinance route a practice.
Congress leader KT S Tulsi said over 30 per cent of Delhi population lives in slums or unauthorised colonies and asked the government if it would make an effort to find a solution to this problem and provide a life of dignity in the city.
He said there can be a beginning of a solution if the government adopts the United Nation's target given to developing nations to set up cities without slums.
Expressing concern over slow progress made in implementation of smart cities and PM-UDAY, Tulsi said, ""If priorities were right, instead of spending Rs 20,000 crore on Central Vista, the government could have built housing colonies and given 1 crore houses with this money.""
BSP MP Ramji requested the government to identify Dalits living in slums in Delhi and provide them houses with basic amenities. He also asked the government to ensure that land mafias are not benefitted from implementation of the bill.
BJD MP Amar Patnaik, YSRCP MP Subhash Chandra Bose Pilli, Samajwadi Party MP Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, DMK MP M Shanmugam, TRS MP Banda Prakash, BJP leader Ashok Bajpai and Anil Agarwal also participated in the debate.",Rajya Sabha passes bill to protect unauthorised colonies in Delhi | Delhi News - Times of India,2,2021

While the interior of the new Lok Sabha will have the theme of peacock, the national bird, Rajya Sabha will have national flower lotus as its theme.

Besides the two Houses, the triangular building will have a Constitution Hall that will exhibit an original Constitution and a digital form for people to read page-by-page. This will be the only portion of the building that will have no storeys. The rest of the complex will have four floors. Each floor will have offices of ministers and committee rooms. The first floor will have dining space for member of Parliament, VVIPs and visitors. It will also have a central lounge.
Triangles are considered sacred in various religions and cultures in India. Besides being earthquake proof, the new building will be eco-friendly and consume significantly less power. The project will be completed in time in 2022 and the winter session will be held here. This will meet future requirements,"" housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.
The government said the New Parliament Building is a necessity in the 21st century. The statue of Govind Ballabh Pant, currently located between Raisina Road and Red Cross Road, will be shifted to GB Pant Marg as the new building will require more space.
Union housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shankar Mishra told TOI that all minute details were worked out while planning the building. The four national symbols will find a place in the building. The National Emblem will be the crown of the building. In the courtyard, we will have a peepal (banyan), which is our national tree,"" he added.
Mishra said the building will have state-of-the-art facilities and a souvenir shop for visitors to buy mementos related to the Parliament.
Officials said the building will have the most modern security and surveillance system. The security check will be mostly non-intrusive. Artisans from different parts of the country will be involved in this project,"" said Bimal Patel, the designer of Central Vista redevelopment project. Dholpur and red stone from Rajasthan will be largely used, as is the case with the existing Parliament. In some of the interior portions, red granite may be used in place of red sandstone.
Sources said provisions will be made in the furniture inside the Houses for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting for members. The digital audio visual system, which will be placed in front of every seat, will have programmable rules-based microphones"", which will put the Speaker in control of who gets to speak and who doesn't.
Every member of parliament, minister and political party will get office space in the New Parliament Building and in the lawmakers' enclave, which will come up on the plot where Transport Bhavan and Shram Shakti Bhavan are currently located, an official added.
These buildings will be connected to the Parliament complex with a tunnel and will have enough parking space. Reports of Sardar Patel Bhavan being demolished are speculative. There is no such plan,"" said another official.","Delhi: New Parliament Building will last 150 years, its Houses can seat 150% more MPs | Delhi News - Times of India",12,2020

In yet another flare up in the ongoing war between the Tatas and the SP Group since the sacking of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons in Oct 2016, the Mistry family group has written letters to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) alleging that the participation of both Tata Projects Ltd (TPL) and Tata Consulting Engineers in the process was a violation of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) rules.
Moreover, the pre-qualification bid criteria was tweaked so as to make it possible for TPL to take part in the bidding process, the SP Group has claimed.
However, sources said the allegations of the SP Group have been rejected in a letter by the CPWD.
When contacted, both SP Group and Tata Projects Ltd declined to comment. CPWD also did not comment on the matter.
In Sep this year, Tata Projects Ltd won the bid to construct a new Parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore ahead of L&T Ltd which had submitted a bid of Rs 865 crore.
Out of seven companies shortlisted, only three -- Tata Projects, L&T and SP Group -- were selected for the final round of bidding.
According to sources, SP Group did not participate in the final tendering process.
The new Parliament building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project, and it is expected to be completed in 21 months.
As per the CPWD, the new building will come up at plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate and the existing Parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project.
In its ongoing battle with the Tatas, last month the SP Group, the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons with 18.37 per cent stake, said it was ""time to separate from Tata"" and end a relationship that has spanned over 70 years.
Tata Sons is the holding company of the over USD 100 billion conglomerate Tata Group. It had objected to the SP Group's plans to raise funds by pledging shares of Tata Sons.
The Mistry family, however had stated that it was ""in the midst of raising funds against the security of their personal assets to meet the crisis arising from the global pandemic"".
The Mistry family-led group had alleged that Tata Sons ""amplified its institutional efforts to suppress and inflict irreparable harm on the SP Group, in the midst of a global crisis triggered by the COVID pandemic"".",SP Group alleges irregularities in Tatas bagging Parliament project bid - Times of India,10,2020

""The green cover will be multiplied 10 times. Not a single tree will be cut. That has been my policy from the day go. There is no question of taking a 100-year-old tree and cutting it,"" Puri said when asked if the ministry's plans for the central vista affect the green cover in the area.
He also said that at this stage only ideas are being floated and there will be widespread public consultation before anything is finalised.
""Public buildings like Rashtrapati Bhavan, North Block, South Block or Parliament, there is no ambiguity about them. The use of these buildings might change - South Block can be used as a historical museum, we might decide to use Parliament as just a chamber for the Lok Saba and build another one. These are all ideas that will be taken on board. Each stage will be in the open. Heritage will stay as it is, it will not only be preserved but also showcased,"" he said assuring that no heritage buildings will come to any harm.

Pandya disclosed that over 50,000 artefacts have already been packed and the work on 15,000 more will be done in the next few days. Items already packed include paintings by Hungarian painter Elizabeth Brunner and over 200 hand-held and glove puppets from Egypt, Chile and Indonesia.

Roy added the packaging has been managed in such a way as to easily unpack the contents in the new environs.

The hotel, which was shut down in Nov 2017, will be revamped to meet the requirement.
Ram Bahadur Rai, president of IGNCA, said, Janpath Hotel has been taken over by CPWD and work on refurbishing the entire place and developing areas as per our needs is under way.

A panel is being set up to oversee the safe shifting of the arts institution's collection of books, paintings and manuscripts. IGNCA has been bequeathed the library collections of 28 eminent Indians, including Namwar Singh, Kapila Vatsyayan, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and Suniti Kumar Chatterji. It also has rare paintings. The centre organises cultural events, conferences and academic activities.
These activities will continue at our makeshift office,"" said Dr Sachchidanand Joshi, member-secretary, IGNCA. It's just that the overall space will be less than at our existing complex, where we have a huge basement storage. So, we will need to plan properly about collections to display and those to keep in storage.""
Joshi was amenable to the temporary convenience, saying, Everything is happening for a better future"". He said that two years, IGNCA would have a bigger and permanent address at Jamnagar House. Around 15 acres of land have been earmarked for the construction of a new building, which will have all facilities to meet our requirements of the next 30 years.""
Joshi claimed that the current building had only a third of the facilities and infrastructure that the institution actually required. The auditorium is small, the conference room has pillars standing in the middle and often proving a hindrance to the smooth conduct of an event. Most importantly, there is much open space that is not serving any purpose,"" said Joshi.
The IGNCA management has visited the office of the architectural firm redesigning Central Vista and redeveloping Jamnagar House.
The temporary relocation of IGNCA is necessary as the government is planning to build the first modern office block on the land which is now occupied by the government-funded arts organisation. Since the built-up area in this plot is very less, so demolishing them and starting fresh construction can start early. Once the office block is built on this plot, offices from a couple of existing Bhawans along Rajpath can be shifted to the new building. Subsequently, we can start reconstruction of these empty buildings,"" said a source.
Officials said the construction of new office buildings will be taken up in a phased manner so that there is less displacement of people. They added that the offices operating from the Jamnagar House hutments and other such complexes in the area will be shifted to a new building, which will come up on a vacant plot on the Kasturba Gandhi Marg and some of these establishments will also be shifted to an office building in Africa Avenue in south Delhi.
Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that the central public works department (CPWD), has bid out the work for shifting of the present reception area and other facilities at Parliament complex to make enough land available for construction of new Parliament.

It is Coronation Park in north Delhi's Burari, the site of royal durbars and the location from where the transfer of the British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi was pronounced in 1911.
Coronation Park was to have been revamped and reopened in 2012, but even today the 52-acre expanse lies in shambles, a veritable dust bowl with all its statuary in derelict condition. The park is sited on the ground where the Delhi Durbars of 1877, 1903 and 1911 were held. It was in the imperial assembly of 1911, commemorating the coronation of King George V, that Delhi was announced the new capital of India and the event marked by the Coronation Pillar. The 21-metre-tall sandstone obelisk still stands, though its structure has been marred by the very Indian malaise of romantic inscriptions.

Delhi Development Authority has now called for a fresh tender for the landscaping to give a proper resting place for the various statues collected over decades. The obelisk has two plaques with details of the 1911 assembly in Urdu and in English, but the statues, including those of viceroys Willingdon, Irwin and Hardinge, are mostly unnamed. Among the celebrated ones is that of King George V brough here after Independence from its perch under the canopy at India Gate.
The park, which saw some landscaping and renovation in 2012, is officially not open to the public. DDA has been developing it into a tourist site in collaboration with Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach). The restoration, with an interpretation centre and restaurants, among other amenities, has missed several deadlines since.
New efforts are on to finish the project. We want to depict the story of Delhi's heritage in this one place. It is at an initial stage right now and the process of getting the consultant on board is under way,"" disclosed Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, principal commissioner, horticulture and landscape, DDA. We have invited bids from specialised firms to help us formulate plans, including how exactly the heritage park should be structured.""
Tiwari said that the consultant that DDA engaged would develop the concept and plan the project in consultation with all the stakeholders, after which DDA would move ahead with the creation of the heritage park. Ajay Kumar, director of projects at Intach, said that the restoration of the historical park should have started by now. Intach gave technical expertise to the development of the park and to conserve its statues and Coronation Pillar, but the place continues to remain under threat from vandals,"" he rued.
Kumar added that just the landscaping of the park would not be adequate. It should have an interpretation centre to teach people about the significance of the location because it is an important historical site, a place where Delhi got its status as an imperial capital,"" he said.","Once all pomp, now no-show: Coronation Park in Delhi awaits revamp | Delhi News - Times of India",12,2020

Puri said some of the buildings in the project zone would be razed as they were built in a hurry"" after Independence to meet immediate requirement. He said some of the buildings don't meet the current needs.
Sources said a major objective was to build iconic buildings and other structures in the capital's power centre that have been lacking in the post Independence period. They added that at several high level meetings it was discussed how Mughals developed Sahajahanabad and built Red Fort while British built the buildings on Raisina Hills. But no such landmark development took place since 1947 with office buildings being added one after the other.

The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, he said.
""The existing temple of democracy is completing 100 years... It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that the new one will be built by our own people as a prime example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat,"" Birla said here announcing details of the new proposed building.
""The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of independence, Parliament session will be held in the new building,"" he said.
Birla said the new building will be earthquake resistant and 2000 people will be directly involved in the construction of the new building and 9,000 indirectly.
He said as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan.
The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said.
He said the invitation will be extended to all political parties. While some would attend physically and others would attend virtually, Birla said, while adding that the ceremony would follow Covid-related guidelines.
A formal invitation to Modi was extended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday. As per rules, the speaker of the lower house of parliament is also the custodian of the parliament building.
Sufficient steps have been taken to control air and noise pollution during the construction work for the new parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs and those will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating 'paperless offices'.
The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.
In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members.
This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.
At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.
In Sep this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.
The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.
The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has twelve gates.

Patel, the president of Ahmedabad's Cept University, will now prepare the massive revamp of the Central Vista (Rajpath), construction of a new Parliament and central secretariat "" a plan that aims at creating a new official district for several ministries and offices.
Sources said the value of all construction and allied works could be around Rs 10,000 crore and the government has set Mar 2024 as deadline for completing all projects, just two months before the next general elections. The idea behind the revamp, apart from better utilisation of the area and getting rid of some of the ageing and crowded buildings, is to create a modern architecture more associated with independent India that would be seen as a succession from the Lutyens' era masonry around Vijay Chowk.

Urban affairs ministry officials said HCP scored high on technical parameters though it had quoted the second lowest amount in its financial bid. While HCP quoted Rs 229 crore, runner-up C P Kukreja Architects had pitched its bid at Rs 218 crore.
Patel, an architect and Padma Shri awardee, heads the firm HCP Design, Planning And Management Pvt Ltd. The firm has developed several modern edifices in Gujarat. These include Modi's prime projects as the chief minister: the Sabarmati riverfront, the Kankaria lakefront, the ministerial block Swarnim Sankul in Gandhinagar, and the Central Vista in the state capital.
Firm has designed more than 70 iconic structures
Patel is also the man behind the Vishwanath Dham corridor plan for Varanasi and the master plan for the Board of Mumbai Port Trust.
HCP was founded in 1960 by Patel's father, Hasmukh Patel. The firm has designed more than 70 iconic structures across the country, many of which "" such as the Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata and the new IIM-Ahmedabad campus "" have turned into landmarks.
Patel's Delhi assignment involves a master plan to house 65,000-70,000 central government employees in a secretariat spread over 12 lakh square meters on both sides of the 3km stretch of the famed Rajpath. These new buildings will equipped with cutting-edge IT infrastructure and will not be taller than the Vigyan Bhavan. The buildings will have open modular offices to epitomize transparent governance.
Optimisation of space will make each building 1.5 times bigger than they are now. The new Parliament building, proposed to be built just 30 metres from the extant structure, will accommodate 800 to 1,000 members in both houses. Patel said if the plan is approved, the 92-year-old Parliament building and the North and South blocks will turn into museums.
The Swarnim Sankul ministerial enclave in Gandhinagar, realized in 2013, reflected the vision of Modiji "" the chief minister then "" of transforming Gujarat's secretariat into a symbol of administrative efficiency,"" Patel said. He wanted better integration of facilities, interaction between departments, and sharing of resources. He was involved in the planning from the very first day."" He said the central government has the same expectations of the new Parliament and the secretariat. Patel said the Delhi project is his most challenging ever"".

Officials said the 20-metre stretch, which will give a glimpse of what the central vista of the heritage market of Chandni Chowk will look like after redevelopment, is still being readied.

Though Delhi government has fixed Mar 2020 as the deadline to complete the redevelopment of the 1.3km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Mosque, the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) had proposed to open a small stretch by Independence Day to give residents and traders an idea on how the road will look once completed.
Though the public works department (PWD), which is executing the project for SRDC, has constructed the central road, built the sidewalks, installed boulevards and benches, beautified the area with greenery and fixed lights, sources said the agency required some more time to finish the remaining work.
We were hoping that the stretch would be ready before Independence Day but it still requires some work. We have informed the SRDC board about it and the urban development minister is likely to inspect the site in a couple of days before a final decision is taken,"" an official said.
The SRDC board, headed by urban development minister Satyendar Jain, met at the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday and discussed the progress of the redevelopment work. Top officials of all departments involved attended the meeting, which went on for almost two hours.
The redevelopment of the central vista of Chandni Chowk, from Red Fort in the east to Fatehpuri Masjid in the west, includes widening of footpath, shifting of electricity and water lines underground, reconstruction of the median to accommodate transformers, installing of police booths, public conveniences and CCTV monitoring kiosks and street furniture. Only non-motorised vehicles will be allowed on the road between 9am and 9pm. The project is estimated to cost Rs 65 crore and scheduled to be completed by Jan 2020.
Sources said the board has also decided to go ahead with its original plan to place power transformers on the central verge, which was opposed by the Delhi Urban Art Commission. Both the Delhi Fire Services and the traders had opposed DUAC's suggestion to shift the utilities from central verge to lanes and bylanes in the vicinity.
The board members have unanimously resolved not to shift electrical units from the median. The decision will be conveyed to the lieutenant governor soon. On the directions of Delhi high court, LG Anil Baijal had asked SRDC to find a way ahead for the redevelopment project, after a crucial meeting of stakeholders last month remained inconclusive.
Sources said SRDC's consultant will explore the possibility of reconstructing the iconic clock tower, which had partially collapsed in 1951 and was demolished subsequently. Minister Satyendar Jain and Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba suggested reintroducing the tower with a turret clock in the iconic market. The minister also suggested rebuilding the clock tower at the same place where it previously stood in front of the Town Hall,"" said an official. The consultant will now explore the possibility if this was possible in the congested market.""

A portion of the large and sprawling IGNCA campus will also be used for constructing an office block, a move that may trigger protests in some political sections given its past association with Congress which had previously criticised the reconstitution of the government-funded organisation's trust.
TOI learnt that the buildings will be razed in a phased manner to ensure there is less displacement of people and to avoid chaos. The PMO had recently asked the urban affairs and housing ministry to avoid major displacement. The ministry has also asked agencies concerned not to raise major maintenance demands for the buildings identified for demolition to build new structures at the same site.
The buildings currently house several ministries including the information and broadcasting and press information bureau, agriculture, urban development, commerce, petroleum, HRD, law, women and child development, social justice, tribal affairs and youth and sports besides other offices as well.
The buildings represent a socialist-era architectural style and have been overlaid by fresh construction and are perpetually short of parking space. The detailed presentations of the proposed revamp of the area, construction of a new Parliament and PM residence near South Block, have been made to PM Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairperson.
On Nov 3 TOI had first reported the plan to shift the PM residence from Lok Kalyan Marg to where the Dalhousie Road hutments now are, just south of Raisina Hills. Recently, the Delhi Development Authority approved the change of land use of this land parcel for residential purpose.
The plan is to free some land parcels and build new structures and then shift offices from existing buildings. This will be done in a phased manner. Once all buildings are complete, a lot of ministries and offices outside the Central Vista zone will move to these buildings. Now we have offices in CGO complex and other such areas. The freed up space can save hundreds of crores of rupees on rent,"" said an official.
He said since there will be modern design for office space, there will be greater scope to accommodate more personnel, adding that there is no decision yet on whether Vigyan Bhawan needs to make way for a state-of-art meeting and convention centre as government weighs requirements in the light of upcoming facilities at Pragati Maidan and Dwarka.
According to sources, the new Parliament building, which will come up opposite to the existing one within the same complex, will see a Lok Sabha chamber with seating capacity of nearly 1,000 and Rajya Sabha with 500. The design of the new Parliament would be similar to the existing one. The facade of existing Parliament building won't be touched, but the inside space restructured for more office space.
The government expects project costs to touch Rs 10,000 crore.

The Army headquarters is currently housed in the iconic South Block at Raisina Hill in Lutyens' Delhi.
The new department of military affairs headed by the chief of defence staff (CDS) will be housed in this new building, Singh said.
The defence minister also performed ''bhoomipujan'' (ground-breaking) ceremony at a venue in the vicinity of the the Manekshaw Centre.
The ground-breaking ceremony began with inter-faith prayers as four religious teachers, representing the four main religions of India, read lines from their sacred texts, wishing prosperity and well being for the building that will come up and people who will work in it.
Singh said the desire of soldiers who laid down their lives was not that people would know and recognise them, but ""their only desire was that India should be a capable and a powerful country"".
This foundation stone will serve as a source of inspiration for others, he said.
""Due to our brave soldiers, our country is known as a capable and a powerful one, and India has the capacity and strength to face big challenges,"" the defence minister said.
Army Chief Gen M M Naravane was also present on the occasion and a large number of defence personnel and jawans were among the audience.
Asked how long will the project take, the Army chief, on the sidelines of the event, said, ""It will take about three-four years for the new building to come up"".
The office of the Army chief is also located in the imposing South Block which is part of the historic Raisina Hill complex built during the colonial era as part of the ""new imperial capital"" of the British Raj.
""About 2,900 officials from the military and 3,100 civilians will be working here,"" a senior official said, adding that the cost of the project would be in excess of Rs 700 cr.
The North Block and South Block, Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) and Parliament House, surrounded by a lush green landscape and imposing fountains, were built during the construction of ''New Delhi'' that started in 1912.
""The new building complex will also have 250 security personnel for whom lodging facility will be there on the campus. The building will comply to 'prestigious norms' and have a GRIHA-5 rating. It will have three entry-cum-exit points -- on NH-44, Parade Road and Link Road,"" the official said.
There will be parking for 4,000 cars, he said.
Singh said, having a centralised office will lead to reduction in number of cars, and ""many persons could even walk to the new Bhawan,"" which will help address the issue of pollution too.
At present, the South Block houses the prime minister's office and ministries of defence and external affairs, while the North Block has offices of the home ministry and the finance ministry. The two blocks fall under a very high-security zone.
Both the blocks, which symbolise the government authority since their inception in Lutyens' Delhi, are likely to be converted into a museum, as part of the government's Central Vista redevelopment project, officials in the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had said in Jan.
The HUA ministry is the nodal agency for the ambitious redevelopment project of the Modi government.
The officials had said that people would have access to the North and the South Blocks once they are turned into museums.

The arts body stated that the structure would dominate the skyline and dwarf the 15.5m-high (from ground up to base of the dome) Gurdwara Sis Ganj Saheb, a landmark building in Chandni Chowk.

DUAC insisted that the Shahjanabad Redevelopment Board reduce the height of the proposed parking facility to 15 metres, as this was essential not only from the security point of view "" due to proximity to Red Fort "" but also for urban aesthetics.
The issue has been a big bone of contention between DUAC and the north corporation. The civic body sees clearance to the parking project as key to the success of the pedestrianisation of Chandni Chowk. The arts body, has also asked north corporation and SRDC to obtain its approval for the work on the central verge of Chandni Chowk, thereby putting the whole project in jeopardy.
The issue came up at the latest meeting of DUAC. In Dec, DUAC held that the any modification/alteration to the Chandni Chowk central vista should be done only after its approval. A section of urban experts has expressed reservations about the redevelopment project. There have been specific concerns about shifting of utility ducts, transformers, sub-stations and even toilet blocks to the central verge where the historic canal once flowed underground.
On the Gandhi Maidan parking project, DUAC has stuck to its stand that a 30m-high building will mar the aesthetics of the area and cannot be permitted in terms of urban form, streetscape and urban design aesthetics, in spite of the fact that other agencies have given height relaxation"". DUAC said the building could have three floors underground and three floors above ground for parking. These three floors above ground can have commercial on the outer periphery and car parking behind.

Pointing out that the work being done by CPWD is not in spirit of the central vista heritage zone"", DUAC has asked the central agency to reconsider the whole project.
The India Gate redevelopment project had come under public scrutiny when ongoing work for National War Memorial, and changes done for uniformity and design"", appeared to alter the original, unique character of the iconic landmark. Well known for its vast open lawns, restrictions on entry, pedestrian plazas, and fencing around the open lawns would change the nature of the India Gate space. Many architect bodies had then come out to oppose the redevelopment plans and petitioned DUAC to halt the project.
DUAC now agrees that India Gate should remain the same as much as possible and dismissed the proposed changes. Musical fountains in the water body are not acceptable. Large lawn surfaces are proposed to be converted into hard surfaces which should be avoided. The proposal seems to have been over-designed by creating too many elements which do not seem to respect the spirit of central vista heritage zone,"" read the minutes of the meeting issued by DUAC.
While the too many elements"" has not been explained, sources say it could include the fencing, redesigning and many other changes in the area. The additional pedestrian path proposed as entry plaza/sitting deck is disturbing the integrity of the existing design and, therefore, needs to be looked into. Only indigenous trees need to be planted in the spirit of the original design. No new row of trees is to be planted. The tourist plazas proposed in lawns 5 and 6 need reconsideration,"" said a DUAC official.
Interestingly, no government agency seems to be taking ownership of the ongoing work. CPWD director general Prabhakar Singh told TOI: We are not doing the India Gate project any longer. It is now with NDMC."" But NDMC officials said they have not yet made any proposals on India Gate and are still in the process of transition"". It is too early to comment and we have not decided anything. We are still planning to make a presentation to the Centre,"" said a top official.
At least four of the six parks forming C-Hexagon are being fenced, modifying the openness of the grassy stretch. Of these, children's park was already a fenced area, while three constitute the National War Memorial which is under the ministry of defence.
Experts are happy that DUAC has finally intervened, though they feel it has come very late. Arunav Dasgupta, head of urban design at School of Planning and Architecture, said, The issue was taken up because it was raised in the public domain repeatedly.

Brick says to you, I like an arch."" If you say to brick, Arches are expensive and I can use a concrete lintel over an opening. What do you think of that, brick?"" Brick says: I like an arch."" "" Louis Kahn
This odd imaginary conversation with a brick was often used by American architect Louis Kahn to explain to students how they must use material around them to find inspiration. So the irony was not lost on anyone when Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM-A) director Errol D'Souza proposed the destruction of the Kahn-designed campus by describing the bricks as second class"" and having an inbuilt efflorescence"" (salt deposit on masonry).
D'Souza also cited structural damage by 2001 earthquake, water seepage and the growing needs of students as a reason to demolish 14 dormitories.
The move met with public outcry, and this week, IIM-A withdrew the proposal.
The now demolished Hall of Nations in Delhi

Kahn's IIM campus is not the only modernist building to face a threat in India today. Architecture historians say there is little understanding of modern heritage. In Apr 2017, the Hall of Nations in Delhi's Pragati Maidan was demolished to construct a new convention centre. In 2016, the demolition of the canteen designed by veteran architect B V Doshi at Ahmedabad's CEPT University sparked an outcry from students and alumni. A decade earlier, the iconic Chanakya Cinema, designed by former dean of the School of Planning and Architecture P N Mathur, was bulldozed to make way for a multiplex. In 2019, Panaji's Kala Academy, an arts centre designed by Charles Correa was also threatened with demolition.
Among the reasons that are put forward in favour of demolition are maintenance costs and the ability to construct a climate-friendly building. For instance, the government has cited Rs 1,000 crore as the annual maintenance cost for upgrading and repairing the bhawans and buildings that will be demolished for the Central Vista project. There are also concerns over structural safety. Former urban development secretary M Ramachandran points out that houses in Delhi's Kidwai Nagar and Moti Bagh had become decrepit. If any structure had collapsed, the government would have been questioned on why it had not done enough for safety,"" he says.
But Moulshri Joshi, architect and representative of the International Committee for Conservation of Industrial Heritage in India, disagrees: We have established practices for retrofitting against earthquakes but it appears to suit everyone to destroy the old and build the new. Would you abandon your grandmother because she is ill and requires care? Then how can we ignore the cultural value of a building,"" she says.
When you think of demolishing a building like Kahn's, says architectural historian William Whitaker, what is at risk is our collective connection with the past. The IIM campus represents the high idealism of a newly independent India and how a civic minded group of industrial leaders supported the establishment of forward looking institutions upon which the economic prosperity of the country could be developed. They recognised that good design and inspiring places, were essential ingredients to the success of this project,"" he says.
India's modern architectural heritage is especially vulnerable because there is no legal protection for buildings that are less than 100 years old. Conservation architect A G K Menon recalls how the Intach Delhi initiated a PIL to object to demolition of the 45-year-old Hall of Nations, but the Heritage Conservation Committee said that only buildings that were 60 years old could be considered for protection. The background for this act in my opinion was that the Trade Fair Authority was under tremendous political pressure to demolish the Nehruvian legacy and construct new buildings,"" says Menon.
However, there are some initiatives in the country to conserve buildings that are part of the modernist movement. In Chandigarh, Panjab University, funded by the Getty Foundation's Keeping it Modern"" project, has prepared a conservation plan for Gandhi Bhawan designed by Pierre Jeanneret.
Conservation architect Shikha Jain says, There is an understanding in the administration that we need to preserve these iconic buildings that have made the city famous across the world.""
Ahmedabad's Calico museum, once the residence of the Sarabhai family, has been adapted to house a museum, and the Golconde dormitory at Puducherry's Sri Aurobindo Ashram, designed by Antonin Raymond and George Nakashima, are well-preserved examples of modern architecture.
Veteran architect Raj Rewal, who had designed the Hall of Nations, suggests another way of conserving our built heritage. He cites the example of the Barcelona Pavilion which was torn down and reconstructed permanently by a group of architects in the 1980s. Since then, architects and artists are regularly invited to create temporary installations in the pavilion, which has inspired many modernist buildings. I hoped that we could have that,"" he says. Buildings which have a value for the next generation must be preserved.""
Architect Gautam Bhatia says there is a need for a blueprint for conservation rather than responding in a piecemeal manner. In India conservation means preservation "" we think of heritage in terms of historical buildings surrounded by high walls where tourists line up to enter,"" he says. In Italy, you can have a restaurant in a 5th-century palace in a commercial district. Our idea of conservation still doesn't link historical ideas to today's life."" Bhatia says India can borrow from building bylaws in Sri Lanka, or the ongoing efforts to preserve Nepal's indigenous timber architecture. There is also a need to think about conservation not just in architectural terms but also environmental ones, including the waste and carbon footprint. We are one of the most overbuilt countries in the world, and we must conserve that we already have,"" he says.",How India's push to modernise threatens its signature buildings - Times of India,1,2021

This evocative eulogy to soldiers who make the supreme sacrifice to defend their country is all set to resonate in the New Year.
The National War Memorial (NWM) is now finally ready, around 60 years after it was first proposed by the armed forces and remained stuck in general politico-bureaucratic apathy, to honour the over 22,600 soldiers who have laid down their lives in wars and operations since Independence. Defence officials say Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the world-class"" NWM, adjoining the India Gate complex on the majestic Rajpath in the capital, on Jan 25. India was probably the only major country not to have a NWM,"" said a senior officer.

The life of an Indian soldier, after all, comes dirt cheap. The NWM will finally fulfil this long-pending emotional demand of the armed forces, which over the years successfully resisted moves to shift it elsewhere or to the outskirts of Delhi,"" he added.
India Gate itself was constructed by the British in memory of the 84,000 Indian soldiers killed fighting for the Empire in World War-I and the Afghan campaign, with the Amar Jawan Jyoti later being built under its arch to honour the 3,843 soldiers who died liberating Bangladesh in 1971.
The NWM, built at a cost of Rs 176 crore after being approved by the government in Oct 2015, was initially slated for inauguration on Aug 15 in 2018, but missed its deadline for completion. Built in keeping with the aesthetics and sanctity"" of the Central Vista and India Gate, it has a layout of four landscaped concentric circles spread over 40 acres.

The NWM, with a central congregation space, has been designed to ensure it does not obstruct the existing layout of Rajpath and its iconic structures,"" said the official.

In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, apart from implementation of OROP (one rank, one pension) scheme for ex-servicemen, the BJP will obviously project the NWM as a major achievement as well.

The Amar Jawan Jyoti (AJJ), in turn, was built under its arch by the Indira Gandhi government to honour the 3,843 soldiers who died liberating Bangladesh in 1971.
The plan is to progressively shift all national-level functions to pay homage to the fallen soldiers to the NWM from the AJJ. The thinking is that all major functions can be held at the NWM, while regimental and other events can be conducted at the AJJ, which too has acquired iconic and emotive status over the years,"" said another source.
Built for Rs 176 crore after being approved in Oct 2015, the NWM basically consists of four landscaped concentric circles around a 15-metre tall central obelisk with the eternal flame, bronze and stone murals, graphic panels and busts of the 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees.

BINNENHOF, THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS

Regarded widely to be the oldest Parliament complex in the world that is still in use, it was built mostly in the 13th century and houses the meeting place of both chambers of the country's bicameral legislature.
16TH CENTURY
PALAZZO MADAMA, ROME, ITALY

The Senate of the Republic, one of the two houses of Italian parliament, has since 1871 met in this building that was completed in 1505 as a residence for the storied Medici family.
17TH CENTURY
LUXEMBOURG PALACE, PARIS, FRANCE

The building that houses the upper chamber of the French Parliament was built between 16151645 as a royal residence. The Senate has met here since 1958.
19TH CENTURY
Close to two dozen of the still operational buildings of legislature around the world were completed in the 19th century, most of them in Europe and the Americas
CAPITOL, WASHINGTON DC, US

The meeting place of both houses of the US Congress, which itself first met in 1789, was completed in 1800 and is arguably the oldest legislature building across North and South America.
PALACE OF WESTMINSTER, LONDON, UK

The buildings from where the Houses of Commons and Lords function were completed between 1840 and 1870s. The site itself had been home to the parliament of England for centuries earlier and saw spells of reconstruction following fires.
20TH CENTURY
The majority of present legislature buildings were constructed in the 20th century with Asia and Africa seeing almost all of their legislatures being opened during this period.
GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE, BEIJING, CHINA

The meeting place of the National People's Congress, the largest parliamentary body in the world with more than 2,900 members, was completed in 1959.
SANSAD BHAVAN, NEW DELHI

Work on the structure, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, began in 1921 and was completed in 1927. Built at a reported cost of Rs 83 crore, the complex is spread over 2.4 hectares.

When they peer over the forest green barricade that now divides the stately sweep from the cupola that once held the statue of King George V to Rashtrapati Bhawan far in the distance, they can see construction work going on.
Foxed visitors unused to barricading on the green space, except around Republic Day, are informed of what is happening by a sign that says, NWM work in progress. Inconvenience is regretted."" NWM stands for National War Memorial, which is finally under construction at India Gate almost five decades after a request was made by the armed forces.

The project at the expanse around the 73-ft cupola looking on to Raisina Hill will commemorate the deaths of over 26,000 soldiers in battles and operations after 1947. The area is now sealed for both those who go there for their daily constitutional and for tourists and visitors. The completion of the memorial, conceived as a landscaped structure with retaining walls bearing the names of all soldiers who have died in battles and operations since 1947, is scheduled for Aug this year and of a war museum at the adjoining Princes Park for Jul 2020.

The area is a popular stop for Delhiites and for tourists, and the construction work will prove a temporary hassle. Sanjay Malik, a tour guide of 20 years' standing, said that after work began a month ago, it has been difficult to park cars here and he has had to make his clients walk some distance to the British-built edifice honouring Indian soldiers who died in battles.
India Gate is a must-visit on Malik's itinerary, and the tourist guide cannot wait for the war memorial to be completed so that the magnificent panorama of power structures, so meticulously planned by Sir Edwin Lutyens, can be back to its inspiring self. At the moment, Malik says, Everything has been covered and the sightseeing experience is hampered.""
Some tourists, however, do not mind the disruption. Saying it was temporary, Praveen Yadav, who had come from Haryana's Karnal district, affirmed he would return with his wife and two children to see the war memorial.
The war memorial project has had a well-debated run-up. In 2012, after the then UPA government mooted the plan, Sheila Dikshit, who was Delhi chief minister at the time, objected to the new structure coming up at India Gate. She said that while she appreciated the need to honour the martyrs, a memorial at Central Vista was not a good idea for two reasons: it wouldn't meld with the historic aesthetics of the area, and it would affect free movement of people due to the security that would need to be mounted for the structure and the war museum.
Mindful of such views held by Dikshit and many heritage experts, Delhi Urban Art Commission gave its approval early this year to the Rs 500-crore project with riders. DUAC advised planners to ensure visual and physical continuity with the Central Vista. Tree planting should be done in a way that the scale and width of the Vista from Rashtrapati Bhawan to National Stadium is continued. The tree lines should be matched with those along Rajpath,"" the panel directed.
The vendors are dismayed at the reduction in the number of people coming there due to lack of parking space. Kishan Pal, who claims to have had an ice-cream stall there for 17 years, said, For every Rs 100 that we earned earlier, we earn Rs 25 now. Business has been hit because people can no longer stop to spend some time on the green lawns."" Pal's words were echoed by another vendor, Naresh Kumar, who set up his food stall two years ago. Kumar said his business had halved because of the decrease in the number of visitors.
Abhijeet Shinde, an NRI, wasn't concerned much about the paucity of parking but was dismayed by the mess at the site. I am sure people will not mind walking a bit to see this magnificent site. But the lack of cleanliness is definitely an eyesore. The authorities should clear the debris lying around,"" said Shinde.
The government, in its 2014 Budget, had made an allocation for the war memorial erection at India Gate. Besides the walls with the names of martyrs inscribed on them, the museum is expected to showcase important aspects of India's military history.","Behind green walls, JCBs get down to work on National War Memorial | Delhi News - Times of India",3,2018

The reason is quite bizarre. Delhi Police "" ignoring the objections by Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) to not vitiate the spirit of the Central Vista heritage zone and its instruction to lower the height of the perimeter fence which CPWD complied with "" has installed the barricades citing security reasons.

DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma told TOI that the fence erected by CPWD is not high enough and does not prevent people from jumping over them to get into the area. The barricades will restrict the number of entry and exit points and ensure that people are stopped from doing so. The police say they screen visitors before letting them into the lawns and Rajpath.
Delhi Police has now written to CPWD to increase the height of the fence and is awaiting their reply. This brings the entire controversy over the fence to a full circle. CPWD had initially began work on installing a five-foot high fence along the periphery of two lawns which had led to a raging controversy.
Security reasons were cited to justify the project. But it lead to an outcry from urban planners who lamented how people were being restricted from accessing one of the few open public spaces left in the city "" a fear that even Sheila Dikshit had voiced when she had opposed the location of the war memorial project. The move was described as undemocratic and anti-people.
DUAC had raised several objections to the redevelopment project. The original design/scheme palate of Lutyens' should not be altered as far as possible and no new hard surfaces on the lawns are permitted,"" it said. To preserve the historical integrity of the area, DUAC said, No fresh ideas/innovations are permitted, only the historically accurate lighting, benches, and other street furniture are allowed."" The proposal for a fountain had also been rejected.
The arts body had very clearly spelt out that fencing is not desirable"". However, if it had to be done, it shouldn't be more than one metre in height and of porous nature so that the view is not obstructed. The design should be in harmony with the surroundings.""
The CPWD, accordingly, lowered the height of the fencing, created a pathway in front of it, and retained the original short white pillars and black chains which give that distinctive look to the entire area.
The cops had other plans. They have now barricaded the entire area to restrict access. What is surprising is that when the project was executed, it seems no objections were raised or at least not voiced publicly. It is an ugly sight now but a DUAC spokesperson told TOI that they were not aware of the matter.
It remains to be seen for how long the barricades stay in place and whether CPWD stirs up a fresh row by doing a rethink on the height of the fencing.",Barricades put up at India Gate citing security | Delhi News - Times of India,5,2019
364,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/building-a-new-parliament-wont-strengthen-indias-democracy/articleshow/71237199.cms,"Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed that a new building be built to replace the old Parliament building. According to him, a brand new structure "" or a substantially upgraded old one "" should be ready by 2022, in time to celebrate 75 years of Indian independence, something that would proclaim the country's eminent position as the world's largest democracy. The PM's statement follows in the wake of Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's assertion that the 90-year-old Lutyens and Baker designed structure can no longer support added demands for space, security and media. She even proposed possible sites for the new building within the Parliament complex.
The idea that the current colonial building has done its time seems misguided and entirely out of sync with the reality of architectural possibilities. The rush to make something afresh springs most likely from an archaic Indian self-absorption with being second rate, and trusting any modern-looking glass fa�ade that may quell that cultural inadequacy.
If history is any guide, some of the world's iconic public buildings make amply clear the longevity granted to them. The Capitol building in Washington DC was built in 1800, and though it has seen no outward additions, it has been modernised by succeeding governments. Numerous changes have been made to its interior layouts, mechanical innards, air-conditioning and acoustic systems; over two centuries, improvements have been continually made in communication equipment, security, lighting etc. Such technical inputs have barely affected the outer architectural shell, which has retained entirely the semblance of the original. The White House too remains entirely true to its 1792 conception. But while the first occupant John Adams used a waterless toilet and a horse-mounted messenger to send letters half a mile away, Trump tweets on the net, has an infinite data storage bank, and the world's most advanced communications network. An impregnable basement office, was added after World War II, in case of a nuclear attack. Through constant upgrades, the historic building remains cutting edge in its operation.
The case of the German parliament is perhaps a better lesson for us. In 1990, after German reunification, the classical Reichstag building in Berlin underwent a major reconstruction, adding a central glass dome in what was an unusual merging of 18th-century elements with 20th-century steel and glass technology. The outcome was hailed as a daring form of composite refurbishment that allowed a delicate mix of wildly disparate aesthetics. The glass dome was built directly above the old debating chamber, environmentally protected by sophisticated heat shields; a system of walkways within the dome allowed visitors distant views of Berlin. Would such innovation ever be practised in a country incapable of assessing the value of its own heritage, and paranoid about VIP security? Could a similar glass dome be built over Connaught Place, or Rashtrapati Bhavan, if required?
One of the more critical problems of designing a new Parliament for a country that now behaves more like an autocracy lies in the deception that the design once built, will itself encourage healthy democratic debate. Should the proposed alteration itself be left to government choice, or be open to democratic debate and selection? Should the design of so major an edifice be thrown open to radical ideas, or be merely handed to the lowest tender, as is being currently planned?
It is hard to read the real motivation behind such colossal public expenditure "" unless of course the call has come out of some deeper insidious cultural strain. Does the government's reading of the proposed refurbishment take into account that the Parliament, the Central Vista and the two flanking Secretariat buildings are all of a 'foreign colonial' origin, and need to be replaced by a 'Hindu' architecture? Perhaps it is merely a concern to project a global view in the public face, in keeping with the push towards a technocratic future "" bullet trains, 6-lane highways and signature bridges. And now a shining Parliament.
Unfortunately, more often than not, slick structures of excessive modernism are a convenient cover for internal incompetence. The belief that a building must look modern to be modern denies the fact that important historical structures can now be retrofitted with utmost sophistication. The Parliament house can be made into a complex machine, bomb proof, secure, digitally active with state-of-the-art gadgetry, communications, comfort etc., without disturbing its status as 'heritage' architecture. But it will take political will, public concern and a deeper understanding of what constitutes Indian heritage to escape the flippancy of the government's ambition to make 'the greatest monument to the world's largest democracy'.

""Earlier governments used defence forces for profiteering and corruption. From Bofors to helicopter deal, all the investigations are pointing to one family and it says a lot. Now these people are putting all the efforts to make sure that Rafale aircraft don't arrive in the country,"" he said.
The PM hit out at opposition's desperation to block the Rafale deal and said despite all their efforts, the Rafale fighter jets will soon fly over India's skies.
Listing out various schemes and measures that the NDA government has taken for the forces, PM Modi slammed the opposition for neglecting the basic needs of the soldiers.
The delay by previous governments in construction of national war memorial was an injustice to families of fallen soldiers, he said.

The Prime Minister said crucial decisions related to defence procurement and strengthening the armed forces were pending but his government cleared them on priority basis.
Addressing the ex-servicemen, he said the government will set up three super-specialty hospitals for them.
PM Modi said, ""Contribution from all parts of society is necessary for security of the nation. Because of this ideology, for the 1st time women are getting the opportunity to become fighter pilots. Decisions are being taken to strengthen the participation of daughters in the forces.""
Taking a dig at the previous governments, he said, ""In 2009, 1,86,000 bulletproof jackets were demanded by forces. From 2009 to 2014, no provision was made for buying these jackets. It is our government that bought more than 2,30,000 bulletproof jackets for the forces.
The PM dedicated the memorial by lighting the flame positioned at the bottom of the stone-made obelisk. Rose petals were showered by IAF helicopters and a fly-past in 'Missing Man' formation was also part of the event.
About the Memorial
Spread over 40 acres in the India Gate complex, the has been executed at a cost of Rs 176 crore and its design was selected through a global competition.
The central part of the sprawling complex has been built in a sunken plot as the design had to respect the heritage look of the India Gate's Central Vista, officials said.
The names of 25,942 battle casualties have been inscribed across 16 walls that consist of granite pieces bearing the name, rank and regiment of the fallen heroes, the officials said, adding that it was built between Feb last year and this Feb in ""record time"".

Besides, the main complex, a Param Yoddha Sthal has also been built on the northern side of the India Gate's C-Hexagon area. The park is dotted with bronze busts of the 21 awardees, fifteen posthumously, of the Param Veer Chakra, country's highest wartime gallantry medal.
The India Gate itself is a war memorial built during the British Raj as the All India War Memorial Arch to honour the soldiers who died in the First World War (1914-1918) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919). The landmark has the names of soldiers inscribed on its surface.

In its latest avatar, it would have an elaborate parade ground, a Wall of Valour engraved with the names of those who died in the line of duty, a sculpture, and an underground museum. But it's the 30-foot sculpture that could offset a new controversy as Delhi Urban Art Commission has declined to approve it and asked for changes given the sensitive location of Lutyens' Delhi. DUAC said that any kind of structure should be of very low height and symbolic in nature"".

The memorial was last opened for the public on Police Commemoration Day in 2016, but was closed after a few days. In 2008, the earlier police memorial was razed as it was found to be ugly"" and blocking the view of Rashtrapati Bhavan. Subsequently, there was a demand for a new memorial. In 2015, the Centre allocated Rs 50 crore for the new National Police Memorial at Chanakyapuri.
The memorial, which is being constructed on a 6.3-acre plot at the northern end of Shanti Path in the heart of the diplomatic zone of the capital, was supposed to be completed by 2016.
The initial proposal was approved by DUAC on Oct 5, 2016, with certain observations. Space had been earmarked for a wreath platform. DUAC then received a communication from the consultant architect for a wreath platform with sculpture,"" said a DUAC official.
When the proposal was scrutinised, DUAC members opined that the structure should respect the urban scale. The information received from the architect was found to be inadequate for scrutinising the proposal, which is to be seen in the context of Shantipath vista vis-a-vis its impact on the skyline. Since the proposal was incomplete, DUAC decided to advise the architect/proponents to submit more information with 3D walkthrough. We asked for more information on the main structure and cannot consider it till these details are submitted,"" said a DUAC official.
NBCC said a revised proposal has been submitted and they were expecting it to be cleared soon.
The memorial would have an underground museum depicting the history, artefacts, uniforms and gear of central and state police forces. The Wall of Valour has space for engraving up to 50,000 names.
The names of 36,050 policemen who died on duty have been etched. These include names like inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who was killed in the Batla House encounter, Mumbai anti-terrorist squad chief Hemant Karkare who died in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, sub-inspector Subhash Tomar who died during the Nirbhaya protests at India Gate and many others,'"" said an official.",30ft sculpture stands in way of police memorial | Delhi News - Times of India,9,2018

The deadline for the completion of the war museum at Princess Park, which will adjoin the NWM at the C Hexagon of the India Gate complex on the majestic Rajpath, in turn, has been set for Jul 31, 2020. Though the timelines may seem overambitious, officials say the construction of the NWM and museum will be undertaken on a war-footing"" now. The projects, which will cost around Rs 500 crore, will be monitored by an empowered apex steering committee under the defence secretary, with a Lt-General heading the project management team and a Major-General as the dedicated coordinating officer"".
For starters, the MoU for appointing the first prize winners of the two-stage global design competition held last year as consultants for the NWM and museum will be inked on Apr 1. While architect Yogesh Chandrahasan and his team won the prize for the NWM ($30,000 award money), the Spa Studio View bagged it for the museum ($75,000). This will be followed by the detailed project reports, which will be completed by May for the NWM and Dec for the museum. The construction contracts, in turn, will be concluded by Jun this year (for NWM) and Feb 2018 for the museum.
All this comes 57 years after the NWM was first proposed by the armed forces, which have consistently raised it with successive governments without much success due to politico-bureaucratic apathy. The Army does maintain around 120 regional and individual war memorials but India is probably the world's only major country not to have dedicated NWM.

The NWM will basically be a landscape-type memorial with retaining walls'', which will have names of all the martyrs inscribed on them. The walls will partly be below ground-level to ensure the aesthetics of the majestic Central Vista are not disrupted, as was earlier reported by TOI. The adjoining museum, in turn, will showcase glorious moments in the military history of India. will, for instance, house the jeepmounted RCL gun used by Havildar Abdul Hamid to destroy at least three Pakistani Patton tanks in the famous battle of Asal Uttar during the 1965 war.

Addressing officers of the 2020 batch in the concluding session of the Assistant Secretary Programme, 2022, Modi said on Thursday that they have the opportunity to serve the country during the 'Amrit Kaal' and help realise the 'Panch Pran'.

They have a key role in ensuring that the target of a developed India is achieved in the 'Amrit Kaal', he said.

The prime minister has termed the period in the run up to the 100th anniversary of India's Independence in 2047 as 'Amrit Kaal' and had spelt out 'Panch Pran' (five pledges) for the duration, including making India a developed country.

In his address, Modi discussed the importance of innovation and how it has become a collective effort and part of work culture in the country, according to a statement.

He noted that the number of startups in the country has witnessed a significant jump in the last few years, and that it has been made possible due to several ministries working as a team through a ""whole of government"" approach.

Asserting that the focus of the governance has shifted outside Delhi, he gave examples of several important schemes being launched from places outside the national capital.

He suggested that officers develop an understanding of the local culture of the area of work and strengthen their connection with local people at the ground level.

The prime minister asked them to focus on ""One District One Product"" and explore the opportunities of exporting products of their district.

He also asked the officers to prepare their action plan for the aspirational districts programme.

Speaking about MGNREGA, Modi highlighted the requirement of implementing the scheme in a more effective manner. He also underlined about the significance of people's participation and said that this approach can play a key role in tackling malnutrition.

Highlighting the success of the Jan Dhan Yojana, he talked about the importance of digital economy and exhorted the officers to try to connect people across villages with digital economy and UPI.

Underscoring the importance of service to the nation, he stressed on the significance of performing one's duties, adding that the mindset of 'Rajpath' has now changed to the sentiments of 'Kartavya Path', a reference to the change in the name of a key avenue in the Central Vista.

Sources said that the tunnel will connect VP Enclave to the new Parliament building in the future through another tunnel that will connect the PM's residence to the proposed Executive Enclave, which will house the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).

Sources also said that it will help ease frequent traffic restrictions during the VIP movement.

The CPWD's bid documents state that the proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit with the highest standards of quality and workmanship.

The total length of the tunnel, which spreads across 1,147 square metres, would be 185 metres and its width is 6.20 metres, it stated. The last date to submit the bid documents is Oct 15. The estimated project cost is Rs 21,31,54,387.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, a new prime minister's residence and prime minister's office and a new vice-president's enclave, among other buildings.

The VP Enclave will have a residence for the Vice President and a secretariat. The CPWD, which comes under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, said that the work to construct a tunnel in the VP Enclave will be carried out on Church Road, New Delhi.

It involves, among others, the construction of a new parliament building, a prime minister's residence and a central secretariat.

What is the plan of this new power centre? The distinct set of challenges of this redevelopment is related to heritage, aesthetics and logistics. A mundane but unique problem is that about 54,000 employees of 39 central ministries in and around the will have to carry on with their everyday work even as architects and engineers go about their job till 2026 or even beyond. The aesthetic question is also partly political: should the state-of-the-art government buildings of the 21st century retain the architectural flavour created by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker in 1911-31? Bimal Patel, chief architect of the Central Vista redevelopment project, tells ET: Lutyens is not copied but weaved in for harmony.""

ET spoke to the Union minister for housing and urban affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri, and other government officials, apart from architects, town planners and urban experts to understand the road map. Kartavya Path, the newly revamped and renamed avenue from Raisina Hill to India Gate ""which was earlier called Rajpath "" is just a small portion of the `13,450 crore Central Vista project.

It involves the construction of 18 new buildings and the demolition of a dozen, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog and Nirman Bhawan. Four heritage structures will be retained "" the present parliament building, North Block and South Block and the National Archives of India (NAI)  all built before 1931. The NAI annexe, built in 1991, will be razed. The Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president of India, has been kept out of the redevelopment scheme. In terms of completion, the next will be the new parliament building,"" says minister Puri.

Our target is to convene the forthcoming winter session in the new building."" According to information available with the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, only six components of the Central Vista project have been sanctioned so far. The first one "" the redevelopment of the avenue "" is now functional. Shapoorji Pallonji was awarded the `477 crore contract for revamping Kartavya Path and operating and maintaining it for five years.

If one walks around the project sites, construction is visible in three locations "" the new parliament being built by Tata Project; three out of 10 buildings that will form the Common Central Secretariat (CCS), being built by Larsen & Toubro; and the vice-president's enclave that is being developed by Jharkhand-based Kamladityya Construction. Two more projects have been sanctioned "" the PM's residence and the executive enclave, which includes the prime minister's office (PMO) and the cabinet secretariat. Financial bids for the executive enclave were received on Jul 15. While the PM's residence will be near the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the PMO will be located behind the South Block, according to the updated layout.

The estimated cost of the projects sanctioned so far is `7,325 crore. The cost of constructing all the buildings, according to an application filed for environmental clearance, will be `13,450 crore.

Puri dismisses the oft-quoted figure of `20,000 crore and says: We don't have an exact estimate right now but we expect to complete the project in about `12,000 crore."" Patel, head of Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management that is developing the entire project, says, All the new buildings will have comfortable, well-ventilated workspaces with plenty of natural light,"" adding that modernisation of old facilities will factor in history and heritage.

Officials connected with the project say that construction will speed up after the three central secretariat buildings are completed. The demolition of old bhawans can begin only after the employees working there are shifted to a new space. The three secretariat buildings (No. 1, 2, 3) are coming up on the site where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) stood. Work began in Feb and, according to a written reply in Lok Sabha in Dec 2021, the deadline for this section, which would cost `3,690 crore, is Nov 2023.

Officials in the know, however, say the work is likely to be completed only by 2024. According to the blueprint, which ET has seen, employees working in Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan will move to the three new secretariat buildings by the end of 2024 or early 2025, paving the way for the demotion of the old structures constructed between 1956 and 1968. Four central secretariat buildings (No. 4, 5, 6, 7) with new features and a common passage running through them will come up in the space where the bhawans stood.

The last three central secretariat buildings (No. 8, 9, 10) are likely to be built in the space occupied by the vice-president's current residence, , National Museum etc., all of which will be demolished. If the process of tendering the remaining seven of 10 CCS buildings begins in 2024, the project is likely to go on till 2026 or beyond. Two non-heritage buildings will remain untouched "" Rail Bhawan, the headquarters of Indian Railways, and Vayu Bhawan, the office of the Indian Air Force.

These could stand out as two odd structures in an otherwise planned landscape. Both these buildings are located in triangular plots with no scope for major land utilisation,"" says an architect, explaining why these two bhawans have been kept out of redevelopment. South Block and North Block "" which now house the PMO as well as the ministries of external affairs, home and finance "" will be the new home of the National Museum.

The buildings, which are over 90 years old and spread over 1.67 lakh square metres, can be an ideal space for a museum, but architects have come across minor issues. We do not have proper drawings to determine the structural strength of these buildings,"" says Patel. When these were built, Delhi was classified as Seismic Zone II. Now the level of hazard due to earthquakes has been calculated as higher than that and the city falls under Seismic Zone IV. South and North Blocks will have to be retrofitted before they become functional again. As far as the National Archives of India is concerned, its papers will have to be catalogued and relocated before the structure is retrofitted and renovated.

At present, arts and artefacts belonging to IGNCA have been temporarily kept at the Janpath Hotel. The new building for IGNCA will come up on a plot opposite the Hyderabad House. OP Agarwal, former urban transport advisor in the , says the new Central Vista must put emphasis on green building concepts and public transportation.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been tasked with constructing an underground metro corridor of 2.65 km with four stations, connecting key points in the new premises.

Kingsway or Rajpath, was a ""symbol of slavery"", and it has now been consigned to history, Modi said after inaugurating the Kartavya Path, and also mentioned the king's statue that had occupied the canopy.

Official sources had earlier said that the installation of the statue would be a case of India ""reclaiming"" its history and shedding a part of its colonial past.

Before the 'monarch' was relegated to the grounds of the Coronation Park in northwest Delhi -- the site of the 1911 coronation durbar, till 1968, he stood under the canopy watching the India Gate, Kingsway -- the ceremonial boulevard that ran up to the Raisina Hill on which the president's house is built.

Soon after Independence, Kingsway was renamed Rajpath and Queensway running perpendicular to it was rechristened Janpath. Rajpath on Wednesday was officially renamed Kartavya Path.

The statue of George V was unveiled in 1939 by the then Viceroy Lord Linlithgow as a memorial to the British monarch under whose reign 'New Delhi' was built as the British Raj's capital, according to archival records.

Born in 1865 in London, George V was crowned as king in 1910, and the next year, he travelled along with his consort Queen Mary to India to attend the famous 1911 Delhi Durbar, where he had also announced the shifting of the capital to Delhi from Calcutta.

King George ruled until his death in Jan 1936, after which memorials were built and statues erected in various cities under the British Empire, the most notable among them being New Delhi -- the administrative seat of a country, which was held as the 'Jewel in the Crown'.

The statue, crafted out of white marble, was designed by famous British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger, and its models were exhibited in 1933 and 1935 at the Royal Academy, according to victorianweb.org, a scholarly resource.

Jagger died in 1934 before he could complete his work, which was then completed by other artists, it says.

According to the archives, the statue of George V beneath the canopy, endowed with royal motifs and surrounded by a pool of water, was unveiled by the then viceroy on Nov 14, 1939.

""The King was everybody's King. More particularly can we who are gathered here be sensible of this personal relationship with the Sovereign, who 28 years ago announced his decision to restore Delhi to its ancient birthright and who laid the first stones of his Imperial Capital,"" Viceroy had said in his speech, according to the Indian Information published in 1939.

According to archival records and old books, the 'George V Memorial' was originally planned to be erected next to the All-India War Memorial Arch (now called India Gate).

Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi, designed the canopy and the layout of the memorial.

Bose's statue is part of the Centre's Rs 13,450-crore Central Vista project, which will have a new Parliament building, new office and residences for the prime minister and vice-president, and new ministry buildings.

The North and South Blocks, the secretariat buildings flanking Rashtrapati Bhavan, will be converted into museums.

A team of sculptors spent 26,000 man-hours of ""intense artistic endeavour"" to carve a grand statue of Bose weighing 65 metric ton from a monolithic block of granite, weighing 280 metric ton, the Culture Ministry said on Wednesday.

A 100-ft-long truck with 140 wheels was specially designed to bring the giant granite statue to New Delhi from from Khammam in Telangana, travelling 1,665 km, it said.

The statue is completely ""hand sculpted using traditional techniques and modern tools"". The team of sculptors was led by Arun Yogiraj.

It has been installed at the same place where a 'hologram statue' of Netaji was unveiled earlier this year on Parakram Diwas (Jan 23) by the prime minister to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Bose.",netaji statue: 'Netaji' sits in India Gate canopy vacated by King George V in 1968 - The Economic Times,9,2022

Apart from the new look, the avenue, one of the most visited places, has been renamed as Kartavya Path. The renaming is part of the the government's policy to 'shed the colonial past.'

""During British rule, a statue of a representative of the Britishers stood here. With installation of statue of Netaji, we've established a new path for an empowered India.

The Prime Minister on Thursday inaugurated the newly-christened Kartavya Path - a stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and also unveiled the 28-ft statue which has been installed in the canopy facing India Gate.

The granite block was sourced from a quarry in Khammam, Telangana. A makeshift road had to be built to carry the stone to a highway before sending it to Delhi.

To transport it to its new home, the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in the national capital, a 100-ft-long truck with 140 wheels was specially designed.

It was brought to life by a team of sculptors who spent 26,000 man-hours of ""intense artistic endeavour"", PTI reported quoting Rajat Mehta, Director, Granite Studio India.

The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has replaced the erstwhile Rajpath signages with new signboards of 'Kartavya Path'. On Wednesday, the NDMC had approved a proposal to rename Rajpath as 'Kartavya Path'.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited has executed the redevelopment of the entire stretch from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. The project was tendered at Rs 477 crore.

The CPWD has set up five vending zones where 40 vendors each will be allowed and two blocks near the India Gate with eight shops each. Some states have shown their interest to set up their food stalls.

The entire stretch has been revamped under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

In a statement, the prime minister's office said over the years, Rajpath and adjoining areas of the Central Vista Avenue had been witnessing pressure of increasing traffic of visitors, putting stress on its infrastructure.

It lacked basic amenities like public toilets, drinking water, street furniture and adequate parking space. Further, there was inadequate signage, poor maintenance of water features and haphazard parking.

Also, a need was felt to organise the Republic Day parade and other national events in a less disruptive manner with minimal restrictions on public movement.

""The redevelopment has been done bearing these concerns in mind while also ensuring the integrity and continuity of architectural character,"" the statement said.

'Kartavya Path' will exhibit beautified landscapes, lawns with walkways, added green spaces, refurbished canals, new amenity blocks, improved signages and vending kiosks.

Further, new pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting are some other features that will enhance the public experience.

An official in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said there would be heavy deployment of police personnel and security guards to ensure that there is no theft and damage to newly-installed facilities. Around 80 security guards will keep an eye on the stretch.

The official said that 19 acres of total canal area have been revamped. They have been fitted with infrastructure such as aerators. There are 16 bridges on the entire stretch. Boating will be allowed in two canals -- one near Krishi Bhawan and another around Vanijya Bhawan.

The official said maintaining cleanliness will be a challenge as people in a large number will throng the Rajpath, which is considered as the most popular public space in the city.

""We appealed to people to maintain cleanliness. Large teams of sanitation workers will be deployed,"" the official said.

Along the Rajpath, the area spreading 3.90 lakh square metre has been developed with greenery all around. Also, the new red granite walkways spreading 15.5 km have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier.

Another official said that parking space for 1,125 vehicles have been created in the entire stretch. A parking space for 35 buses has been created near the India Gate.

Seventy-four historic light poles and all chain links have been restored. Over 900 new light poles have been installed. Concrete bollards have been replaced with over 1,000 white sandstone bollards to maintain the precinct's character.

According to the ministry, over 400 benches, 150 dustbins and more than 650 new signages have been installed on the entire stretch.

One hundred and one acres of lawns have been replanted with different species of grass, appropriate to their location. Proper slopes and drain channels have been integrated to minimise damage caused by the stagnation of water.

Four new pedestrian underpasses have been built at busy junctions to segregate vehicular traffic from pedestrian movement, making the street safe to cross.

The ministry said the tall amenity blocks and underpasses have ramps with railings at suitable heights for safe use by children and the specially-abled.

It said that arrangements for the Republic Day Parade have been standardised and integrated.

""Modular bleachers have been proposed for the Republic Day seating arrangements, saving time and effort in setting-up and dismantling, and reducing damage to the lawns,"" it also said.

The light poles are fitted with necessary technology and services for the annual Republic Day Parade, connected to the newly laid underground service lines, it added.

The stretch will open for the public after 20 months. On the day of the inauguration, visitors will not be allowed on the stretch from the India Gate to Man Singh Road, but they can use the remaining part. From Sep 9, the entire stretch will be thrown open to the public.

The Delhi State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) had last week recommended the SEIAA to give green nod to the project.

The SEIAA discussed the project at a meeting on Wednesday and approved it.

The Forest Department had on Aug 23 granted permission to the Central Public Works Department, the user agency, to transplant 487 of the 807 trees at the site under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.

During the meeting, the SEIAA noted that the project will lead to the removal of 60 percent of the trees at the site.

""SEAC/SEIAA tried to get the PP (project proponent) to reduce felling of trees but only a few could be saved.

""The project design was presented as fait accompli (something that's already done). No attempt was made to make any major change in the footprint of the building that would have led to tree preservation on the site,"" it said.

CPWD officials said the proposal was submitted for environmental clearance in Dec last year.

The SEAC, which vets the proposals before they are sent to SEIAA for clearance, had earlier this month set up a sub-committee to examine the implementation of the Delhi government's policy for tree transplantation and review the site plan in order to retain trees.""

Under the policy notified by the government in Dec 2020, agencies concerned are required to transplant a minimum of 80 per cent of the trees affected by their development works.

The benchmark tree survival rate at the end of one year of tree transplantation is 80 per cent.

The sub-committee in its report said the tree survey was not carried out at the time of project feasibility assessment and site identification.

The SEAC, which first examined the proposal in a meeting on Jan 31, had raised concern over the CPWD's plan to remove an ""excessively high proportion"" of trees from the site.

The CPWD later revised the proposal, decreasing the number of trees to be transplanted from 630 to 487 and increasing the number of trees to be retained at the site from 154 to 320.

In a meeting held on Apr 9, the SEAC decided to recommend the revised proposal to the SEIAA for grant of environmental clearance.

The SEIAA, however, referred the matter back to the SEAC to ensure that provisions of the tree transplantation policy are complied with.

According to the revised proposal for the Rs 1,381-crore project, the CPWD will maintain 1,022 trees at the site, so as to have a tree every 80 square metre of plot area as per the guidelines of the Union environment ministry.

A total of five buildings with a built-up area of 90,000 square metres will be constructed at the site after demolishing the built-up area of 47,000 sqm.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new parliament building, common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice president enclave.",Executive Enclave: Central Vista: Delhi panel gives green nod to 'Executive Enclave' which will house new PMO - The Economic Times,9,2022

Tata Projects Ltd is constructing the new Parliament building which will have a grand constitution hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.

""The main structure (of the new Parliament building) has been completed. We are now at the stage where we are doing a lot of internal finishing work,"" Pai told PTI in an interview.

""... it is one of its kind, so the finishes are very well thought out by the architects, procuring that and doing all the finishing,"" he added.

The government has maintained that the winter session of Parliament will be held in the new building being built under the Narendra Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

Replying to a question on how Tata Projects is coping with the challenge of high inflationary pressure, Pai said there are definitely challenges which most of the industries are facing as they rely on a lot on commodities.

""So, one one thing which we have to constantly look at is procuring smart. So, we have long-term contracts on a lot of our bulk material purchases we do,"" Pai said.

The other thing by now, he said, many of the contracts have matured where the procurement agreements have price variation clauses.

""So, that gives us protection, it might not really give us the full nature of the increase, but a good part of it gets mitigated by those clauses where we get support for that,"" Pai said.

Asked if the input cost of construction has risen due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said that the steel prices have gone up, and there are some speciality items including speciality steel which is getting delayed.

""The oil prices have gone up, we have a lot of mobility requirements within our project site. We use a lot of diesel generators and equipment.

""So, yes the input costs have gone up to some extent,"" he said.

Russia started its military offensive against Ukraine on Feb 24. Western nations, including the US, have imposed major economic and other sanctions on Russia following the aggression.

He observed that there is a huge opportunity in the infrastructure sector in India, especially in the renewables.

The government had aimed at completing the new Parliament building before the winter session which usually starts from the third week of Nov.

The building is a once in a lifetime and complex project that is being constructed on a very challenging timeline, the sources said, asserting that construction has been going on round-the-clock with all hands on deck.

The building's civil works are almost complete, but finishing touches, electrical, among other works, might continue till the end of this year, they said.

Works such as making furniture, carpets, wall murals and other items for furnishing the building are going on along with its construction, the sources said.

They suggested that at this moment, it is difficult to specify a completion date. Therefore, one cannot rule out the winter session being held in the old building, the sources said.

The sources said authorities are confident that the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament -- Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha -- on the first day of the Budget Session will be held in the new building.

With construction work on the Parliament premises, several of its entry and exit points are closed.

The new triangular Parliament building is part of the redevelopment project of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor. The project also envisages a common central secretariat, new prime minister's residence and prime minister's office, and new vice-president's enclave, among others.

Even after the building is fully furnished, the sources said, around 15-20 days would be required to acquaint and train staffers to ensure smooth conduct of Parliament sessions and all assistance to MPs.

For this, mock drills and exercises would be organised for Lok Sabha Secretariat, Rajya Sabha Secretariat, National Informatics Centre, ITDC and house keeping staffers, they said.",parliament: 'Parliament's winter session could be held in old building' - The Economic Times,10,2022

A lot more permanent bridges can also be seen over the canals, making the space beyond the canals accessible for public use.

The refurbished Central Vista Avenue with added new public amenities is set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, with the Rajpath renamed as Kartavya Path.

74 historic light poles, and all chain links have been restored, upgraded, and reinstalled on site. More than 900 new light poles have been added wherever necessary to ensure that the space is always safe for visitors, reports said.

Concrete bollards have been replaced with 1000+ white sandstone bollards to maintain the precinct's historical character, and the pedestrian sidewalks along the Rajpath have been paved with robust and durable materials.

Four new pedestrian underpasses have been built at busy junctions, segregating vehiclular traffic and pedestrian movement.

The sprawling edifice covering an area of nearly six acres and its creamy sandstone colonnade of 144 pillars on the first floor is one of the most distinctive parliament buildings anywhere in the world, and one of the most defining and widely-recognised structure whose foundation was laid 101 years ago.

The Monsoon session of Parliament ended on Monday, four days ahead of schedule, after continued disruptions during the last three weeks over various issues.

The new Parliament building, whose foundation was laid in Dec 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is being constructed in its vicinity and the work is expected to be completed before the Winter Session. It was earlier expected to be completed in time for the 75th anniversary of India's Independence Day on Aug 15 this year.

If the Winter session takes place in the new building, it will mark an end of an era that the British-era architectural icon has witnessed in its 95-year-old journey, including the dawn of Independence in 1947.

While the tricolour replaced the Union Jack atop its majestic roof when India threw off the yokes of the British rule and the Viceroy House neighbouring it built around the same period soon assumed the avatar of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Parliament building has essentially remained timeless albeit for a change of few names.

Parliament House and Sansad Bhawan are both used interchangeably in official parlance, while the building was named as a Council House when it was conceived by the British in 1920s after the imperial capital was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi after the grand durbar of 1911.

The odyssey of the old Parliament building is also the journey of the new capital of India built under the rule of the then monarch King George V, later christened New Delhi by him in 1926, less than a month before the inauguration of the circular landmark.

On Feb 12, 1921, when the nation was still in the making and Independence 26 years away, Britain's Duke of Connaught laid the foundation stone of Parliament House and said it would stand ""as the symbol of India's rebirth to yet higher destinies"".

On its foundation centenary day last year, parliamentarians from various parties had sat in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for the budget session and work continued on a new parliament building close by, while the milestone was a blip in history unnoticed by many.

The building, with a diameter of 560 ft and circumference of one-third of a mile, was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, who along with Sir Edwin Lutyens was chosen to design the new imperial capital in Delhi on a site in the Raisina Hill area.

Placing the first building block of what would become the imposing circular, colonnaded structure that is the heartbeat of India's parliamentary democracy, Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, had recalled the grandeur of the Acropolis in Athens.

He was an uncle of King George V, then reigning monarch of the British Empire, and laid a huge block of red sandstone bearing inscriptions in Hindi, English and Urdu in that order. It carries his name and the historic date in Roman numbers -- ""XII Feb A.D. MCMXXI"".

""I need only recall the Acropolis of Athens, the Capital of Rome, and the great cities of the East famous in past ages for their splendour and culture. India herself is rich in such precious legacies. From the granite pillars on which the Apostle Emperor Asoka engraved his imperishable edicts, onwards through the chequered centuries, down to the splendid palaces of the Moghal Emperors, every age has left behind it some monument commensurate with its own achievements,"" the Duke of Connaught said.

Records show the grand ceremony took place with then Viceroy Lord Chelmsford - a recreational club named after him still stands a stone's throw away - and a large number of ruling chiefs from princely states and other dignitaries in attendance.

The architectural masterpiece, which was originally called Council House, was inaugurated six years later in 1927, 20 years before India attained its freedom on Aug 15, 1947, by then Viceroy Lord Irwin.

According to the plan, the building was to be constructed to house the imperial legislative chambers -- the central legislative assembly (which took the form of the Lok Sabha), the Council of State (became Rajya Sabha) and the Chambers of Princes (now used for other purposes) -- along with a Central Hall to house a library and a place to hold joint sessions. All within the aesthetic round structure.

In 1929, Bhagat Singh hurled a bomb into its chambers. At the Central Hall is where Jawaharlal Nehru welcomed India's 'tryst with destiny' as India became independent on Aug 15, 1947, and where the Constitution took shape.

Over the decades, as India evolved into the nation it is today, Parliament House has been witness to many moments in history - from cerebral debates to high-decibel, raucous discussions and the passing of legislations, some landmark and others controversial.",Monsoon session: Was Monsoon session the last sitting at old Parliament building? - The Economic Times,8,2022

Over 27,000 police personnel have been deployed on Republic Day security duties in Delhi and anti-terror measures intensified, officials said.

According to the officials, the police personnel deployed include deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, inspectors and sub-inspectors. Armed Police Force personnel and commandos, officers and jawans of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have also been deployed.

CCTVs fitted with a facial recognition software and anti-drone equipment have also been installed, police said.

All major border points of Delhi, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, have been sealed to ensure incident-free and smooth Republic Day celebrations unlike last year. Extra pickets have been deployed and patrolling has been intensified at the border points, the officials said.

On Jan 26 last year, thousands of farmers protesting against three agriculture laws of the Centre entered Delhi on tractors and wreaked havoc on the city roads. They clashed with police and even hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort, a privilege reserved for the Indian tricolour.

""We have sealed the borders and put up extra pickets in coordination with our counterparts. No commercial vehicles will be allowed to enter the national capital. Only permitted vehicles and those engaged in essential services will be allowed. Non-permitted vehicles will be sent back while at some borders, traffic diversions and alternate routes are also in place,"" a senior police officer said.

The security personnel are keeping a hawk-eyed vigil over the venue, where President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be celebrating the occasion along with other dignitaries and thousands of people.

""We are fully prepared. We have been preparing for almost two months now. Elaborate arrangements with multi-layered security have been made all around the district. Vehicle checking would start at the borders of New Delhi district and it would become more and more stringent as you move towards the venue,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said.

Only vehicles with authorised passes or control passes that have already been issued will be allowed to move towards the function area, he added.

All the high-rise buildings have been covered with rooftop arrangements and anti-drone equipment has been installed on a number of these structures, the DCP said.

""With the help of multiple agencies, we have taken adequate measures against any kind of a drone attack or anti-social elements. At the same time, we have also briefed our staff to take adequate precautions to curb the spread of COVID-19. At the time of entry and exit, the staff have been briefed to ensure that it is done in a phased manner and there is no crowding at the entry and exit points,"" he said.

Briefing the media on Saturday about the security arrangements, Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana had said a total of 27,723 Delhi Police personnel, including 71 DCPs, 213 ACPs and 753 inspectors, have been deployed for the Republic Day parade. They are being assisted by 65 companies of the CAPFs.

Police said anti-terror measures have been intensified in coordination with other security agencies.

""Since the last two months, we have intensified our anti-terror measures. These measures have been taken on 26 parameters very intensively. It is also because Delhi has always been a target for terrorists and anti-social elements. This year too, we have been very much alert,"" Asthana had said.

He mentioned that the anti-terror measures include blockades (naka bandi) at various places, checking of vehicles, hotels, lodges and dharamshalas and various verification drives like that of tenants, servants and labourers.

Counter-drone technology is being used for air space security. Security in and around the area where the Republic Day celebrations will take place has also been beefed up, Asthana said.

Security arrangements for the Central Vista project have also been made in coordination with the officers of the agencies working on the project, he added.

Besides the Delhi Police, other agencies have also been deployed to ensure foolproof security. About 200 teams have been working towards it.

About traffic arrangements, the police commissioner said an advisory was issued detailing specific restrictions on routes so that no inconvenience is caused to the public.

Talking to ANI at Central Vista Avenue, Puri said that after the redevelopment, the green coverage has been increased. ""Central Vista Avenue itself has been widened. Now, the walkways are of 12 to 15 kilometres. The water bodies have been cleaned. It's a new effect"", the Union Minister added.

While talking about the challenges faced during the completion of the Central Vista project, Puri said, ""The meaning of challenge is that you have to meet the challenge. The challenge has been met and it has been met in a timely manner.""

'Despite the COVID pandemic, 4,000 people had been working round the clock. So, I am grateful to them, I am grateful to my colleague and ministry. Whenever we had required their cooperation, we got in full measure from all departments"", he added.

Puri criticised the opposition parties' remarks over the Central Vista project. ""First they were told that this project would not be completed in a timely manner. Second, there was some concern from the environmentalists. But we addressed everything.""

According to him, out of 25 trees, 22 trees have been relocated to other places. ""I am hopeful that the new Parliament building will also be complete by Oct this year"", said the Union Minister.

It is worth mentioning that after the completion of Central Vista Avenue, additional space up to 40,000 square metres would be accessible to people. Besides this, new sidewalks have been added in place of the red sand path, resulting in 94,600 metres of walkable pathways.

""As many as 422 new stone benches have been installed. With this, there will now be 16 bridges on the canals. Amenities like restrooms have been added which will be differently-abled friendly. Tourists will also have access to a step garden where people can come and sit, said Puri.

In addition to new features, The Rajpath will now have underground stormwater drainage and a micro-irrigation sprinkler system to deal will puddles and waterlogging.

The parking facility has been increased and would now be able to house 50 buses and 1,000 vehicles at the same time. The Avenue will now have four underpasses -- 150 metres in length, at the Janpath - Rajpath crossing and C-Hexagon.","Central Vista Avenue is ready with new effect, says Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri - The Economic Times",1,2022

""Visited Central Vista Avenue to review progress of the project. Despite the unprecedented rains a few days ago & the current Omicron outbreak, work is progressing on schedule,"" Puri tweeted.

Last month, the project's architectural consultant had said that the Central Vista Avenue stretch required to host the Republic Day Parade this year would be ready in time, but some facilities would be completed later.

The apex court also for the first time got as many as nine judges in one go including Justice B V Nagarathna, who is poised to become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027.

The year witnessed change of guard at the top of judiciary with Justice N V Ramana, hailing from an agriculturist family of Ponnavaram village in Andhra Pradesh's Krishna district, taking charge as the 48th CJI upon retirement of his predecessor Justice S A Bobde in Apr. The collegium led by the CJI made a slew of recommendations leading to filling up nine vacant posts in SC and over 100 posts in high courts.

For the first time, three women judges -- Hima Kohli, Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi -- got the judgeship at the top court. The Justice Ramana-led collegium ended the 21-month-long logjam over appointment of judges to the apex court when nobody was appointed after the superannuation of the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi on Nov 17, 2019.

With the country witnessing an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19, the apex court passed several directions to assuage the miseries of the citizens. But the judiciary lost legal luminary Soli Sorabjee due to coronavirus. Another sad news came as the top court lost sitting judge Mohan M Shantanagoudar in Apr.

In a significant verdict, the apex court refused to refer to a larger bench to revisit its 29-year-old Mandal verdict, putting cap on quotas at 50 per cent, as it quashed a Maharashtra law granting reservations to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, saying it violated the principle of right to equality.

It also said that reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes in local bodies concerned in Maharashtra cannot exceed an aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and OBCs taken together.

Later in the year, it directed the State Election Commission of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to notify the seats reserved for the OBCs in local bodies in these two states for the general category.

The Centre got mixed results in 2020 in the apex court which gave the green signal to the strategic Chardham highway project near China border after taking note of security concerns and also junked pleas to stall the ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

The top court found ""no infirmity"" in grant of environment clearance and other permissions for the Central Vista and at the fag end, dismissed another plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where new residence of the Vice President is proposed.

It also upheld the Centre's power to extend Sanjay Kumar Mishra's tenure as Director of the Enforcement Directorate but clarified that extension of officers after the age of superannuation should be done rarely and in exceptional cases.

However, it trashed opposition of the government to pleas for probe into alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance and appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to investigate under the monitoring of former apex court judge R V Raveendran, saying the state cannot get a ""free pass"" every time the spectre of national security is raised and it cannot be the ""bugbear"" that the judiciary shies away from.

It also intervened to ensure fair probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people including four farmers were killed during a protest as it appointed Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to monitor the investigation of Uttar Pradesh SIT which will also have three IPS officers.

The apex court, which took back its 2020 order of extending period of limitation for filing cases due to the pandemic saying the country was returning to normalcy, again found itself in the midst of the brutal second wave and passed a slew of orders on issues ranging from delivery of oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, insurance for frontline workers, helping sex workers, migrant labourers, kids in street situation and those orphaned by COVID-19 and payment of ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of those who died of the infection.

Terming the resurgence of Covid cases as ""national crisis"", the CJI even advanced the Supreme Court's summer vacation and also ordered decongestion of prisons by ordering immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole in 2020.

The top court said black marketing of critical COVID-19 drugs and oxygen is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery and directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute offenders.

Highlighting the digital divide between rural and urban India, it posed searching queries to the Centre on mandatory registration on CoWIN for Covid jabs, vaccine procurement policy and differential pricing, saying the policy makers must have ears on ground to effectively deal with the unprecedented crisis.

At the fag end of the year, the court was dismayed over the poor air quality in Delhi-NCR and asked the Centre-appointed panel to work on finding a permanent solution to the menace.

The year also saw the Supreme Court staying till further orders the implementation of three farm laws and constituting a committee to listen to grievances of the protesting farmer unions', which held an over a year-long protest at Delhi borders, as also make recommendations to resolve the impasse.

The three farm laws were subsequently repealed leading to a situation where a clutch of pleas challenging their validity and others against the blockade by farmers in the apex court became infructuous.

The much-anticipated corporate battle resulted in a victory for the Tata Group with the top court setting aside appellate tribunal NCLAT's order which had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the USD 100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.

In a major victory for US-based e-commerce giant Amazon, the apex court held that Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator award, restraining the Rs 24,731 crore merger deal of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail, is valid and enforceable under Indian arbitration laws.

Nine years after taking up cudgels against Supertech, home buyers finally got relief from the top court as it ordered demolition of the under-construction twin 40-storey towers which would have blocked sunlight and fresh air, violating building norms in collusion with NOIDA officials.

During the year, it also put the curtains down on suo motu proceedings initiated to probe a ""larger conspiracy"" behind sexual harassment allegations against former CJI Gogoi in Apr 2019.

It also closed the nine-year-old criminal proceedings that were initiated in India against two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the Kerala coast in Feb 2012, after Rs 10 crore compensation was paid by Italy to heirs of the deceased and the boat owner.

It also said that according to the international arbitral award accepted by India, Italy shall resume further probe in the case against the marines -- Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.

In another significant verdict, the top court said the Delhi Assembly and its committee have the power to compel attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of privilege.

At the inaugural ceremony of two office complexes for the employees of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces here on Sep 16, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the Winter Session of Parliament next year would take place in the new Parliament building.

Addressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event, he had said, ""I would like to assure you that the redevelopment work of Central Vista Avenue will be completed in two-and-a-half months, where the Republic Day parade will be held.""

In his written reply to Tewari, Kishore said Rs 1,289 crore has been allocated for the development/redevelopment works of Central Vista in the ongoing financial year.

The minister said these works have provided direct livelihood opportunities to more than 10,000 skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers on site and off site and generated more than 24.12 lakh man days of employment.

In addition, substantial employment in manufacturing and transportation of cement, steel and other building materials have been provided, Kishore said, adding these works will also contribute to the economy and help realize our resolve for ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"".

He also said that there is no link between works pertaining to Central Vista and Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS).

""Separately, the Union cabinet, in its meeting on Nov 10, has restored MPLADS for the remaining part of the Financial Year 2021-22 and its continuation from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26 with an outlay of Rs 17,417 crore,"" he said.","central vista project: Central Vista Avenue project has achieved 60% physical progress, govt tells Lok Sabha - The Economic Times",12,2021

""Kindly have it after three weeks. Nothing is happening to these properties. My learned friend (petitioner) can rest assured. We are before your lordship. It is a very long plan and we have not reached anywhere near it,"" said the solicitor general who represented the Centre.

The court adjourned hearing in the case till Jan 20, saying it has ""full faith"" in the Solicitor General and turned down the request of the senior lawyer representing the petitioner to take the statement on record.

In its petition, the Delhi Waqf Board - represented by senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose -- has sought the preservation and protection of six of its properties in the area in which the redevelopment work is ongoing -- Masjid Zabta Ganj at Mansingh Road, Jama Masjid at Red Cross Road, Masjid Sunehri Bagh Road Near Udyog Bhawan, Mazar Sunehri Bagh Road behind Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Masjid Krishi Bhawan inside Krishi Bhawan Compound and Masjid Vice President at the official residence of the Vice President of India.

The bench perused the affidavit of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change and referred to the long and short-term measures suggested by the commission on pollution and asked Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan to file affidavits by Wednesday evening about the compliance of the directions.

""The question is now we are struggling as to how to control the pollution and whether it is Central Vista or polluting industries or the states... Do you think that we do not know anything?

Everything can be criticised but it should be constructive criticism"", the apex court observed and said it was a policy matter and the authority concerned has offered sufficient explanation to justify the change in land use of the plot.

We find no reason to examine the matter further and therefore put a quietus to the entire controversy by dismissing this petition,"" a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said.

The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar, was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.

As the petitioner's counsel argued that the change in land use of the plot is not in public interest and they are seeking to only protect the green and open area, the bench orally asked, Hereafter, recommendation will be taken from common citizens as to where the Vice President's residence should be?"".

The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioner said they are not on the location of the Vice-President's residence but the change in land use is not in public interest as these are open and green areas.

It is not some private property which is being created there. It is for Vice-President's residence as per the affidavit,"" the bench observed, adding, In Vice-President's residence, there is bound to be green area around.""

The counsel said the petitioner cannot have any objection as far as residence of Vice-President is concerned.

When he said that six acre of green area is being proposed to be taken over, the bench observed that it is a matter of policy.

Unless you are alleging mala fide, how can we go into that issue. On what ground can we interfere. The judicial review will be in respect of what?"" the bench said.

It said the affidavit filed by the authority give reasons as to why the change was necessitated and it also says that some other areas have been added to increase the greenery.

It is a fact that it was never used as recreational ground,"" the bench observed.

The apex court said even if it is assumed that the plot was used for recreational purpose in the past, is it not open to the authority to make changes which are essential for the holistic development of the area.

The petitioner's counsel said that in larger public interest, they are seeking to only protect the green and open area.

He said like 'salami slice', a smaller portion of land is taken and then the authority says it is compensating it.

The counsel argued that the affidavit filed by the authority is vague and no green area or open area is compensated in the Central Vista region.

Is it a matter of arithmetic that if 10 metre area is taken, then 10 metre area has to be provided at other place,"" the bench said, adding, After having seen the affidavit, is it possible for you to say that it was done mischievously, with mala fide.""

The counsel said they are invoking the public trust doctrine.

We are not impressed with this argument. If you have some better arguments, we will consider that,"" the bench said.

Delhi has experienced severe air pollution in the months of Nov and Dec in the past few years whenever wind speeds reduce. This period also coincides with stubble burning in adjoining states, vehicular pollution, etc, adding to the issue.

To tackle this, the engineering company has put up a wind breaking wall around the entire 3km periphery of the site.

The barrier wall controls air currents and prevents erosion by obstructing the wind near the ground and stops the soil from blowing off-site, a source told TOI.

Furthermore, eight anti-smog guns have been installed at vantage points, which spray fine droplets of water over the site which helps dust particles settle down, and curbs creation of any further dust amid digging and other construction activities.

The project has to be completed by the contractor before Jan 26, 2022 as the Republic Day parade will take place on Rajpath. The efficacy and adequacy of the pollution-control measures were being monitored by a dedicated team, a senior company official said.

Four water tankers have been provided for periodic sprinkling of water, while care is being taken to limit dust pollution from stone cutting and grinding works. Alongside, there is an automatic wheel washing facility made at the exit gate with more to be installed in the weeks to come.

To maintain air quality, the company is carrying out ambient air monitoring through an NABL-accredited agency.

The Central Vista revamp, announced in Sep 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

The apex court was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.

The bench had earlier asked the Centre to file a short affidavit on the issue.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner had said the authorities have not demonstrated any public interest as far as the change in land use from recreational to residential for the plot is concerned.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had told the bench that official residences for the Vice-President and the Prime Minister are stipulated on the plot.

Mehta had said the recreational area could be shifted but he also cited security concerns considering that Parliament would come up there.

The bench asked whether he would like to file a short affidavit on the limited point raised in the matter.

In Jan this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.

The top court's verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.

The top court had in Jun this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID pandemic.",Central Vista: SC to hear plea related to change in land use on Nov 16 - The Economic Times,10,2021

All these firms are being checked for qualification to participate in the financial bids, he adding the financial will soon be called once the evaluation process of the documents submitted by these four firms is completed.

""High-speed river flow from UP is the main cause for the foam formation over the river in Delhi especially in the Kalindi Kunj area,"" Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said quoting the scientists of Delhi Jal Board.

Addressing a press conference in the national capital, the environment minister cited ""multiple reasons"" as a cause for the increase in the pollution levels during the winter season in Delhi and its nearby areas.

Rai further said in the meeting to discuss pollution levels in Delhi NCR, that the AQI level is likely to reach over 400 from Nov 1.

He assured that a 'monitoring committee' will be formed to keep a watch over construction works that are still in progress despite the imposition of a ban in the wake of the deteriorating air quality of the National Capital Region.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas imposed this ban on Saturday stating that all construction works other than the one of Central Vista need to be stopped amid the rising pollution levels.

The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) sub-committee decided to implement Stage III of GRAP in the entire NCR in a move to prevent further deterioration of air quality.

He highlighted that the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Anand Vihar and Vivek Vihar has been reported highest at the levels of 440 and 408 respectively, Rai added.

Accusing the BJP-led central government for the stubble burning in Punjab -- which is another cause of pollution in neighbouring cities including Delhi, the environment minister said, ""Punjab government is ready to give financial support to the farmers after banning stubble burning but it is the Centre which is not ready to contribute to it monetarily.""

The decision of the Delhi government to ban firecrackers was also criticised by the BJP and they are also not letting the onset of campaign 'Red light on, Gaadi off' here.

""BJP is also restricting the Red Light On, Gaadi Off campaign, despite the fact that it helped bring pollution down to 15 per cent levels in the national capital in the previous year,"" he said.

Rai on Thursday had claimed in a press conference that the campaign was to be rolled out on Oct 28, however, it was being postponed as the approval was due from the L-G's office. He added that the file was sent on Oct 21 for approval.

Denying the charges, L-G office sources said that the file that was sent to the L-G office mentioned Oct 31 as the date of rollout instead of Oct 28 as claimed by the Delhi minister.

Further mentioning about the cleanliness of Yamuna, Rai emphasised on the five years' time sought by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal stating that such a ""huge problem cannot be resolved in two days.""

To address the deteriorating air quality of the National Capital Region, the Sub-Committee for invoking actions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the CAQM in NCR and adjoining areas held an emergency meeting on Saturday.

This meeting was conducted after the third phase of GRAP in Delhi NCR.

While comprehensively reviewing the overall air quality parameters during the meeting, the Commission noted that due to unfavourable meteorological conditions with slower wind speed and sudden spike in farm fire incidents, it is considered necessary to implement Stage III of GRAP with immediate effect in the entire NCR.

""As per the dynamic model and weather/ meteorological forecast, the overall air quality over Delhi is likely to remain in the Very Poor to Severe category from 29.10.2022 to 30.10.2022. The air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain in a Severe category from 31.10.2022 to 01.11.2022 and for the subsequent 6 Days, the air quality is likely to fluctuate between the Severe to Very Poor category,"" read the official statement from CAQM.

The CAQM further noted that the winds are forecasted to be calm in the coming days and the wind direction is likely to change course frequently. Thus, there is a high likelihood of the pollutants getting trapped in the region and not getting dispersed effectively.

The CAQM had further appealed to the citizens of NCR to cooperate in implementing GRAP and follow the steps mentioned in the Citizen Charter under GARP. Apart from that, a 9-point action plan as per Stage III of GRAP was made applicable in the entire NCR.

The 9-point action plan includes steps to be implemented/ ensured by different agencies and Pollution Control Boards of NCR and DPCC, as per the official statement.",gopal rai: Heavy flow from UP caused foam on Yamuna: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai - The Economic Times,10,2022

The plea was filed by two lawyers who argued that the new sculpture was in violation of the Act.

According to the petitioners, the lions in the new emblem appear to be ferocious and aggressive with their mouth open and canines visible, in contrast to the state emblem preserved in the Sarnath Museum in which the Lions appear to be calm and composed. Finding no force in the contention, Justice Shah, in oral remarks, said the ""impression the Emblem gives depends on the mind of the person."" The petitioners further argued that the logo of ""Satyameva Jayate"" was absent in the statue.

The petitioners contended: ""The state emblem of India is the mark of the identity of the Republic of India. When this identity is interfered with, it hurts the national sentiments of its citizens.""

In a series of provocative remarks here, he said leaders in Delhi send their condolences even when a dog dies but none of them expressed grief on the death of ""600"" farmers over the course of the agitation against the Centre's three agri-marketing laws. He also referred to the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi, asking the government not to antagonise the Sikh Community.

He said there are people in the government who are in favour of the farmers but ""one or two people"" are arrogant. Appointed Governor -- in Jammu and Kashmir and Goa, before being posted to Meghalaya -- during the Narendra Modi term, Malik has been taking swipes at the government. The latest remarks were made during an address to the Jat community in Jaipur. Malik said he is not afraid of losing his position as Governor for targeting ""Delhi leaders"" over the farmers' issue and will step down whenever he is asked to do so.

The Meghalaya Governor said the protesting farmers will not return from Delhi empty-handed, but after gaining success. Referring to the Republic Day violence when farmers in their tractors headed to the capital's Red Fort, he said after the prime minister it is the right of Jats and Sikhs to hoist the national flag there. Farmers from the two communities form the bulk of protesters at Delhi's borders.

Malik claimed that the Army has also felt the impact of the protest as the sons of farmers serve there. He said when injustice happens, some day people react to it. In an indirect reference to the farmers' protest against BJP leaders in Haryana, he said Chief Minister M L Khattar's helicopter cannot land in any village in the state.

He also targeted the government over the Central Vista redevelopment project, saying it would have been better if it built a world-class college instead of a new Parliament building as the country lacks quality education. He said the farmers' issue can be resolved by addressing the subject of minimum support price (MSP). Even before the new farm laws were passed in Parliament, the Adani Group had set up its godown in Haryana's Panipat, he said.","malik: Satya Pal Malik backs farmers, criticises Central Vista; says not scared to step down as Governor - The Economic Times",11,2021

According to top government officials, the upcoming museum, as part of the Central Vista project, will not be a ""mere relocation"" of the existing National Museum to a new site, but ""an aggregation of museums"" from across the country. The proposed facility, likely to be spread across 1.5 million sq ft with 50-60% of it to be used for the display of artefacts, is being planned to be a ""premier cultural destination that forges a sense of national identity"".

Starting from the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh that feature prehistoric cave paintings to India's freedom struggle, the museum will showcase different aspects of the making of India and Indians right from 10,000 B.C to 1947 CE.

Official sources said the museum could even be the largest in the world, even slightly bigger than Louvre Museum, the world's most-visited museum and a historic monument in Paris. The plan for the new museum has been prepared after studying best practices from the Smithsonian museums and those in Malaysia, Sydney and some others that have come up in the last ten years. The work on the project will begin in Jul 2024 and completion is likely to be in 2025-26.

As per the outline envisaged by the culture ministry, the new museum will ""vividly demonstrate different aspects of India or Bharat that always existed in a cultural and spiritual sense even if historical exigencies have prevented the attainment of nationhood."" The museum, according to the government proposal, ""shall be the largest museum of the country and one of the world's premier cultural destinations exploring India's glorious past, illuminating the present and imagining the future"". ""Creation of such a grand national museum is not instrumental in showcasing the evolution of national identity but also symbolic of the nation's greatness,"" it said.

Nearly 95% of the display items at the proposed museums will come from other museums which is why the existing National Museum had last week floated an expression of interest (EoI) for a storage facility for its hundreds of artefacts. As of now, nearly 5,000 exhibits from the National Museum are expected to be taken to the new museum.

The broad contours of the proposed museum on Raisina Hill will cover aspects of India such as its civilisational history, including aspects from the Indus Valley time, the evolution of Janapadas, ancient kingdoms and dynasties, evolution of Indian languages and their scripts, crafts and workmanship, stone tools, sculptures, Indian science and medicines, invention of zero, discoveries made by Indian scientists and number systems.

There will also be special focus on Indian knowledge systems such as Vedas, Shastras, books, Granths, the greatness of Indian universities such as Nalanda and Takshashila and currently IITs, Indian fashion, jewellery and textiles, Indian paintings from miniatures to Deccani and modern, food habits of Indus people, every-day cooking, royal cuisines and solah shringar, various installation arts, the evolution of Indian economy, trade and agriculture, coinage, currency, epigraphy, intangible heritage such as folk arts, Indian music from chanting of shlokas to the heritage of ragas and gharanas, and lastly freedom struggle.

""The effort is to create a national identity through a museum. Many countries have done it and we have looked at the best practices. We don't have one such museum right now and the attempt is to create a museum that can cover most aspects of what made us who we are today,"" a person associated with the project said.

As with regard to existing artefacts at the National Museum, it has already floated an EoI, stepping up the efforts to create a state-of-the-art 'centralised storage' facility for 195,000 antiquities and precious artefacts, under proper supervision.

Modelled on international standards similar to repositories in Germany, Hungary and France, the repository will be a treasure for academic researchers, and the storage facility will be good for the next 100 years, officials said, adding that other museums will also be welcome to use it. The proposed facility, likely to come up around the same time as the commencement of the museum project, will also house a conservation laboratory including learning divisions such as digitisation unit and research centre.

The existing National Museum building was established in 1960 and storage was designed according to the antiquities available at that time. At present, about 7,000 objects are on display there. In the last three years, the museum has been particularly engaged in a multi-ministry attempt to reposition India as the most important Buddhist hub of the world. Three new galleries here have come up to assert India's credentials as the birthplace of Buddhism, from where it spread to other countries, including China, and also to show the long-lasting influence of the Buddhist art. The project is aimed at the G20 meeting scheduled to take place in 2023, when many international dignitaries will visit New Delhi, and is also a significant cultural diplomacy move, considering only recently PM Narendra Modi inaugurated an international airport at Kushinagar where Lord Buddha is believed to have attained Mahaparinirvana, giving a major boost to India's image as the most important destination for all Buddhists.

The National Museum now also has on display many Central Asian antiquities, which were part of its repository for a decade but were never showcased earlier, making India the fourth country to display such a collection, after the UK, Germany and Russia.

The government also claimed that it was aware of the public nature of the projects. The government has plans to add various public facilities in the city as part of its larger vision plan for the future and has on its own created a lot of space for recreational purposes, it said.

The final approval for diversion of forest land is to be granted by the central government.

In Aug, the Delhi government had recommended the proposal for approval of the REC ""in larger public interest subject to the conditions laid by the forest department"".

There are more than 250 trees per hectare at the site. Therefore, it was treated as ""deemed forest"" and required approval for diversion for non-forest activity under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, a Delhi forest department official said.

Of the existing 2,219 trees at the site, the Central Public Works Department seeks to transplant 1,734 and retain 485 trees.

The three office buildings, which will be part of the Common Central Secretariat, are to be built at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore, with Rs 139 crore set aside for five years' maintenance.

The REC approved the CPWD's proposal in a meeting held on Aug 24 subject to certain conditions.

It said the land for compensatory afforestation should be made available to the Delhi Forest Department, free of all the encroachments and encumbrances, within 15 days of the approval and compliance submitted to Integrated Region Office, Jaipur.

""Translocation scheme needs to be submitted before IRO, Jaipur as per species and age classes suitable for translocation. Forest land will be handed over only after required non-forest land for the project is handed over by the user agency,"" the minutes of the meeting read.

The CPWD has informed the Delhi Forest department that it will transplant 1,500 trees at NTPC Eco Park, Badarpur. The location for the remaining trees is being finalised.

According to the agency, there are 1,179 trees, including the 485 retained ones, in the proposed ""landscape plan"" of the project. The CPWD has proposed 8.11 hectares of land near Dhulsiras village in Sector 29, Dwarka for compensatory afforestation.

During an inspection conducted in Jul, the forest department found the land suitable for CA, according to documents seen by PTI.

However, compensatory afforestation can only be done after pruning of ""invasive species of trees on 20 percent of the proposed land"", the forest department has told the CPWD.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 requires that afforestation is carried out in compensation for forest land diverted for non-forestry uses.

Compensatory afforestation can be done over an equivalent area of non-forest land or over degraded forest twice in extent of the area being diverted, if non-forest land is not available. According to the ministry's guidelines, at least 1,000 saplings per hectare have to be planted on the identified non-forest land.""

""Therefore, 8,110 saplings will be planted at the site in Dwarka,"" a forest department official said.

The CPWD will be allowed to start work at the IGNCA site only after it deposits Rs 7.07 crore and hand over the required non-forest land to the forest department for plantation work, he said.

According to the CPWD, Central Vista houses only 22 of the 51 ministries of the central government. In some cases, a ministry has offices split between different buildings. This scattering of ministry offices across Delhi hampers the efficiency of administration and increases operation costs and energy usage.

The consolidated Common Central Secretariat will have modern offices and facilities for all 51 ministries, it said.","central vista project: Central Vista project: CPWD proposal for diversion of deemed forest land gets 'in-principle' nod; 1,734 trees to be transplanted - The Economic Times",9,2021

434,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/change-is-unsettling-but-dont-oppose-central-vista-without-looking-at-its-pluses/articleshow/83682407.cms,"The upcoming Central Vista, a project to upgrade top Central Government workspaces, has faced quite a bit of criticism with opponents citing issues with costs, plans, approvals and timing. Perhaps what bothers them the most is the audacity of this government to alter the look of Central Delhi's most hallowed landmarks.

The English-speaking elite opposing the project fondly remember the old days when one family remained in power and the elite had a monopoly on opinion in the country. These Central Delhi landmarks are a reminder of that era, before social media and before the average Indian had a greater say in who is in power. To this elite, the Modi government is still like a bad dream, which, they hope, will end soon.

The Central Vista Project challenges that. It's scary, unsettling and creates anxiety. Is Modi really so powerful that he can even change Rajpath? Well, yes, he can. He's in fact a lot more powerful than merely having the ability to modify a few government offices. And it's the people who have given him this power.
Frankly, if there's a plan to renovate, consolidate and make creaky government offices more efficient and modern, must we oppose it tooth and nail?

The project hopes to achieve five main benefits. One, it envisages a new state-of-the-art Parliament building because the current one is dilapidated, old and too small to fit future MPs. Two, the biggest benefit is that it will create new ministry buildings, all adjacent to each other, akin to a campus along Rajpath. At present, ministries are spread kilometres apart, causing work delays, poor communication and those annoying traffic snarls with VIP movement (the project seems worth it just to cut the VIP movement traffic snarls!). Three, a new defence enclave will consolidate senior defence offices, again a reasonable move. Four, a new PM's residence, which again makes sense as the current one is far away, creating daily traffic and security issues. Five, it will create new museums in the earlier buildings like the old Parliament House and North and South Block.

If we had to achieve these same goals but without any disruption to the existing fa�ade at all, there were two more options. The first, renovate the existing old buildings to modern standards, while preserving the entire external structures. Many government buildings in Europe work this way. However, preserving and upgrading heritage structures costs a lot more, especially on an ongoing basis.

The second option is to move the entire government, and make a new campus at another site (such as Naya Raipur in Chattisgarh). In Delhi, this would mean probably moving past Gurugram or Noida, given there's no such empty land available in the capital itself. Again, this would cost a lot more and take much longer. Also, post the shift the current sites could turn into ghost towns.

Given the above, the current Central Vista project seems to be well-conceived. It is designed as a minimally-invasive fa�ade surgery but gets the job done. Yes, we do lose the India Gate gardens. That is sad. However, we save billions compared to the alternatives. The spending is spread out and doesn't impinge on other welfare projects or pandemic-related spends.

Does that mean that the Central Vista project raises no concerns and issues at all? Of course not. Like any big government project, there should be accountability. The project should indeed be minimally invasive, on paper, in practice and in spirit. Personally, I have two minor concerns. One, is the final look of the new Parliament. At least in the 3D software rendering videos, the new Parliament was pink and white in color, and resembled a wedding cake. I hope that isn't the final shade. Stick to natural shades, in harmony with the existing structures and tree cover. Second, there seem to be too many museums being created. Perhaps from my childhood school picnic memories, I have Indian museum trauma. Indian museums are insanely dull and need to be modernised. Unless they plan to put an IMAX theatre in the old Parliament building, add some virtual reality sections in the North Block or have beautiful caf�s in the South block, these museums will simply gather dust. Make the museums, but make them ultra-modern, interactive and clean. Have staff that doesn't look sleepy or annoyed at seeing yet another batch of school kids (told you, childhood trauma).

Old British architecture was indeed beautiful. However, contemporary India has also made beautiful buildings. Mumbai's T2, Delhi's T3, the Biswa Bangla Convention Centre in Kolkata and Mahatma Gandhi Mandir in Gandhinagar are all examples of good modern Indian architecture, where form meets function. I am sure that with a billion plus eyes on the architects and contractors, they will deliver on Central Vista.

Change is unsettling, but let's not be opposed to change for the sake of it. In fact, let's support and look forward to the new Central Vista!","Change is unsettling, but don't oppose Central Vista without looking at its pluses - The Economic Times",6,2021

What does it aim to accomplish and what are the objections to it?

The legislative branch of India is currently housed in the Parliament House. The executive branch, consisting of the President, Vice-president, Prime Minister and 51 ministries, resides in numerous buildings in and outside the Central Vista. In its original form, as completed in 1931, the latter consisted of the President's House, Parliament House, North and South Blocks and National Archives. Expanded need for office space led to the addition of the Central Secretariat buildings such as Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, Rail Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan during 1956-68. Today, 39 ministries are housed in these buildings in the Central Vista while the remaining 12 in rented spaces outside of it.

Built in times when even window air conditioning and telephone were considered luxuries, digital age was decades away and space was plentiful, these buildings are highly inefficient at accommodating modern amenities and technologies and make highly inefficient use of space. Moreover, several ministries are located far away from Central Secretariat buildings paying nearly Rs 1,000 crore in rental annually.

With India emerging as a global player, it is important for its national government to be housed in spacious modern buildings. Moreover, offices must be designed for the digital age. There should be enough space to house all ministries within quick reach of each other.

These are the objectives behind CVP. It includes a new building for the parliament; rejuvenation of the Central Vista Avenue (CVA); new residences for the Vice-president and PM; a new PMO; a new common central secretariat that would bring all 51 ministries in a complex of internally connected buildings; new, modern and significantly more spacious homes for the National Museum, National Archives and Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA); a new garden near Yamuna; and a biodiversity arboretum.

The estimated cost of the project is Rs 20,000 crore and it is slated for completion in 2026. The first phase, launched in the current fiscal year, aims to complete the new parliament building and rejuvenation of the CVA at the total cost of Rs 1,339 crore.

It would seem that a project that modernises the seat of the national government, makes efficient use of scarce space and beautifies the national capital would be welcome by all. But it is not so.

Critics argue that instead of wasting the sum of Rs 20,000 crore on new buildings, the government should use them to alleviate poverty. But this is a spurious argument. While a nation must surely strive to assist its poor, it must also invest in its future. Going back to the 1950s and 1960s, if PM Nehru had followed the critics' prescription, we would have had no nuclear and space research programmes, steel mills, large dams or many of the existing government buildings! Even the India-China war did not lead Nehru to neglect non-defence investments necessary to secure India's future.

Related, an eminent economist has contended that it is callous"" to launch CVP in the midst of Covid pandemic when the country needs fiscal resources to help the poor and combat shortages of medical supplies. This is an equally spurious argument. For the sum of Rs 1,339 crore, devoted to the first phase of CVP, has in no way compromised the financial resources available for combating shortages of medical supplies or protecting the poor. If we have had to struggle for medical supplies during the massive second wave, it was because of physical shortages of oxygen, medicines and medical personnel, not scarcity of financial resources.

Activists also contend that the project would lead to the demolition of many iconic buildings. But here the government has unequivocally stated that none of the heritage buildings including India Gate, Parliament House, North and South Blocks and National Archives is slated for demolition. Demolition or redevelopment is limited strictly to buildings constructed in the 1950s or later.

On a visit to Patna in 2016, I had a chance to visit Patna Museum. I was completely blown away by its rich collection of sculptures and other artifacts from ancient India. One regret I carried back with me, however, was the poor display of this national wealth. In contrast to the museums in Washington DC, London and Paris, priceless artifacts were displayed entirely exposed and crammed in small rooms.

In 2019, I had the good fortune to pass through Patna once again. I used the few hours at my disposal to visit the newly built Bihar Museum. Once again, I was blown away but this time not by the artifacts, most of which I had seen before, but by their superb display. We now had a museum that rivaled the best in the world in display and arguably beat them in content.

I mention this experience because CVP proposes to do for the National Museum, National Archives and IGNCA what Bihar Museum has done for the exquisite artifacts originally housed in Patna Museum. The project will provide homes to the collections of these institutions that would be spacious and accessible to all to benefit from.

Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was ""not justified"" in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause ""by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence"".

It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a ""serious public health issue"" concern.

The move comes after the area's civic body recently issued a notice approving the renaming of the historic road at its special meeting on Sep 7.

Signages around the India Gate hexagon are mounted on stainless steel-made unipoles with horizontal plates bearing white text on green background.

Late Friday night, one of the signages with three green plates bore name of two streets -- Sher Shah Suri Marg and Dr Zakir Hussain Marg -- while 'Rajpath' inscribed earlier in the top plate could be seen scraped off, as also from other signages that bore the old name.

Sources in the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) said the erasure of 'Rajpath' from signages were being taken up by authorities working on the redevelopment project after the official nod to the rechristening. It will be replaced with 'Kartavya Path'.

New, big signages bearing the new nomenclature of the ceremonial boulevard have been put up on the streetsides. Many youths were seen taking selfies with new signages bearing 'Kartavya Path' on a wide shining green board erected on the erstwhile Rajpath.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi, who is also a member of the NDMC, had on Sep 7 said: ""However, after 75 years of independence, it is felt that the name of Rajpath needs to be changed, in tune with the values and principles of democracy and a contemporary, new India. The Kartavya Path will also inspire everyone who visit or cross the road to perform their duties towards the country, the society and their families,"" she said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the 'Kartavya Path' on Sep 8 and it was thrown open to the public from Sep 9. He had urged people to take selfies with it and upload it on social media.

The hustle and bustle around India Gate is back.

The revamped stretch of rechristened Kartavya Path - from Raisina Hill complex to India Gate - and the verdant lawns surrounding them were thrown open to the public on Friday after two years. The stretch was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day ago.

The central attraction is the 28-ft-tall statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, carved out of a monolithic block of jet black Telengana granite that was unveiled by Modi a day earlier.

Young and old, locals and foreigners were seen enjoying the redeveloped India Gate complex, as they took selfies with the 65 metric tonne statue housed in the historic canopy facing the war memorial arch.

Manish Bhandari, a graphic designer drove from Ghaziabad along with his wife, mother, two-year-old daughter and five-year-old nephew to see the revamped India Gate complex.

""I last came here in 2017 and we used to play cricket, but it's all changed now. The place looks neater and the underpass is a great help,"" he told PTI.

Near him, a couple - Raj Kumar, 71, and Madhu Sharma, 68 - sat on newly installed red sandstone gravels reminiscing about the area in the early 1970s.

""Some things are the same and some things have changed. But I feel the revamp was overdue. The place has a fresh appeal for the youth. I used to come here with my wife after marriage. I had come to see the National War Memorial earlier and today I came here after it was shut due to Covid in 2020,"" Kumar told PTI.

""I like the new statue, and we have also come to see the drone show,"" Kumar said.

Public parks and various institutions were shut in Mar 2020 after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the successive lockdowns.

A few months later, the Central Vista project's groundwork began and since then the Rajpath and India Gate complex and the lawns surrounding them were not accessible to the general public.

On Thursday, Modi inaugurated the Kartavya Path and urged people to visit it and take selfies with it and upload them on social media. New signages bearing the new nomenclature of the ceremonial boulevard have been put up on the streetsides.

A senior Culture Ministry official said people are thronging the India Gate area and the 'Kartavya Path'. Two step-amphitheatres and four stages have been set up on this road where cultural performances are being hosted.

Sources said the events will now be a bit subdued due to the state mourning to be observed on Sep 11 following the death of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II.

Shahzad Khan, 19, a Jharkhand native who recently moved to Noida, was also among the visitors who enjoyed the first day after the opening of the India Gate complex.

""I have come to Delhi for the first time. So far I have seen India Gate on TV and in films. So, I can't tell the difference between old and new avatars of it, but I missed the Amar Jawan Jyoti that flickered eternally beneath its historic arch,"" he said.

Manish Bhandari hoped that people will exhibit greater civic sense and not litter the streets as some visitors used to do earlier

""It is our pride, our heritage, and we all must respect it while enjoying it,"" he said, as he took a brisk walk to see the granite statue of Bose.

The statue has triggered a selfie craze and some visitors even chanted 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' while standing in front of the rotary around it.",kartavya path: Revamped India Gate complex stirs selfie craze among people - The Economic Times,9,2022

Modi inaugurated Kartavya Path, earlier known as Rajpath, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate here on Thursday.

He thanked workers involved in the development of the 2.5-km-long Kartavya Path and said that they not only built it but also showed others the way of 'kartavya' (duty).

Neeraj's 19-year-old teammate Vasudev Kumar was also elated to have met the prime minister, who invited him to the 2023 Republic Day celebrations as a ""special guest"" with his family.

""I will definitely come with my family to attend the Republic Day function as it is a matter of pride for me and my family members,"" Vasudev, who hails from Bihar's Katihar district, told PTI.

As part of the inaugural ceremony, folk artists from different parts of the country performed on the Kartavya Path.

The performance of the Kalbelia dance group was among the key attractions of the event.

Speaking at the event, Modi said the renaming of the stretch has given the country a new energy and inspiration.

Four new pedestrian underpasses have been built at busy junctions to segregate vehicular traffic from pedestrian movement, making the street safe to cross.

According to an official, 74 historic light poles and all chain links have been restored, upgraded and reinstalled on the site and more than 900 new light poles have been added where necessary to ensure that the space is always safe for visitors.

The ceremonial boulevard of the national capital running from the Raisina Hill complex to India Gate began its journey as Kingsway, a majestic central axis in the heart of New Delhi that was built here after the imperial seat of the administration was shifted from Calcutta (now Kolkata) as announced by British monarch King George V in 1911.

Soon after Independence, Kingsway was renamed to Rajpath and Queensway running perpendicular to it was rechristened as Janpath.

Now, Rajpath has been renamed as Kartavya Path and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday inaugurate the newly-christened stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate as part of the revamped Central Vista Avenue.

On Dec 15, 1911, King George V and his consort Queen Mary laid the foundation stone of the 'new capital' of the British Raj.

In consonance with the vision of the king, architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker built the new capital city, whose grandeur and architectural splendour rivalled the best of the cities in Europe and America.

The centrepiece of this new capital was the Raisina Hill complex, housing the majestic Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) and North Block and South Block forming the Imperial Secretariat.

A grand axis was laid from the Great Place (later renamed to Vijay Chowk) to India Gate by the architects with verdant lawns, fountains and ornamental lampposts on both sides, forming the resplendent Central Vista Avenue.

Baker created a circular Parliament House near the Rashtrapati Bhavan which was inaugurated by the then Viceroy Lord Irwin in Jan 1927.

The city, constructed between the two World Wars and which took over 20 years to build, was inaugurated on Feb 13, 1931 by the same viceroy.

On India's Independence on Aug 15, 1947, the boulevard from Raisina Hill to India Gate was chock-a-block with people, welcoming the dawn of a free India which shook off the yoke of a long colonial rule.

India then became a Republic on Jan 26, 1950, and Rajpath has been the venue of all Republic Day celebrations since 1951.

Only the first Republic Day celebrations was held at Irwin Stadium (now Captain Dhyan Chand National Stadium) behind India Gate complex, where the Rajpath stretch ends.

The Rajpath and the Central Vista lawns flanking the promenade were officially renamed as Kartavya Path, as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) approved the renaming and issued a public notice in this regard on Wednesday.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi, who is also a member of the NDMC, on Wednesday said that Rajpath was known as Kingsway during the British rule, while Janpath was known as Queensway.

""However, after 75 years of independence, it is felt that the name of Rajpath needs to be changed, in tune with the values and principles of democracy and a contemporary, new India. The Kartavya Path will also inspire everyone who visit or cross the road to perform their duties towards the country, the society and their families,"" she said.

NDMC Vice Chairman Satish Upadhyay said the proposal was received from the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).

On Thursday, Modi will also unveil the 28-ft statue of Bose at India Gate, housed in its ornamental canopy.

The famed canopy, standing on four columns of the Delhi Order devised by Lutyens for the new capital's main buildings sitting on the Raisina Hill complex radially opposite the India Gate on an long and wide axis -- Rajpath, had been lying empty since the statue of King George V was removed in 1968 and later dumped at Coronation Park in northwest Delhi, ironically the site of the 1911 coronation durbar.

The imposing marble statue of King George V housed under an ornamental canopy facing India Gate was unveiled in 1939 by the then Viceroy Lord Linlithgow as a fitting memorial to the British monarch under whose reign the capital of 'New Delhi' was built, according to archival records.",kartavya path: From Kingsway to Kartavya Path: The journey of majestic Rajpath - The Economic Times,9,2022

The government said the move is part of a continuous and conscious effort by the prime minister to shed the baggage of colonial legacy and colonial symbols and replace those with Indian traditions and strategic thought.

In a background note, the government highlighted numerous steps taken in this direction in the last eight years:

Rajpath to Kartavya Path

* In line with its intention of getting rid of any remnants of the colonial past, Modi has decided to rename Rajpath and the Central Vista lawns as ""Kartavya Path"". Rajpath is the Hindi word for ""Kingsway"", which was given in the honour of King George V.

New naval ensign

* On Sep 2, Modi unveiled the new ensign (Nishaan) of the Indian Navy that he said ""removed the remaining traces of slavery and a colonial past"" on the country's warships by doing away with the St George's cross. The move is befitting the rich Indian maritime heritage.

* The Cross of St George was removed from the Indian Navy's ensign and replaced with an ensign inspired by the seal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Renaming Race Course Road as Lok Kalyan Marg

* The prime minister had announced his intention to abolish the images of the colonial era during his Independence Day speech on Aug 15. However, the process had already started in 2016 when Race Course Road was renamed as Lok Kalyan Marg. The prime minister's residence is at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.

Redundant colonial-era laws repealed

* Since 2014, the government has repealed more than 1,500 old and obsolete laws. Most of these laws were remnants of the British era.

Merger of the railway budget with the annual Union budget

* In 2017, breaking a 92-year-old tradition, the government merged the Rail Budget with the General Budget.

Presentation of the Budget on the first day of Feb

* It has also done away with the colonial-era presentation of the Budget on the last day of Feb. The budget is now presented on the first day of Feb.

Grand statue Of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate canopy

* In Jan, Modi inaugurated a hologram statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate. A statue will soon be installed in the canopy where a statue of King George V was installed earlier. It was removed in 1968.

Replacement of 'Abide with Me' from the 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony

* During Republic Day this year, the ""Beating the Retreat"" ceremony's concluding piece, ""Abide With Me"", was removed and Kavi Pradeep's seminal piece, ""Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon"", was introduced.

* Earlier in 2015, the ""Beating the Retreat"" ceremony saw some major changes wherein Indian musical instruments such as sitar, santoor and tabla were added for the first time. The retreat was thus infused with an Indian flavour.

Merger of Amar Jawan Jyoti with National War Memorial

* Amar Jawan Jyoti, the ""eternal flame"", was merged with the flame of the National War Memorial (NWM).

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands renamed

* In Dec 2018, Modi took a page out of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's book and renamed three islands of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. Back in 1943, Bose had suggested that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands be renamed as Shahid and Swaraj Dweep respectively.

* In a tribute to the freedom fighter, Ross Island was renamed as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep, the Neil Island as Shaheed Dweep and the Havelock Island as Swaraj Dweep.

Biplobi Bharat Gallery inaugurated at Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata

* The prime minister recently inaugurated the Biplobi Bharat Gallery at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata. In what has been named after an erstwhile British empress of India, Modi inaugurated a gallery displaying the contribution of the revolutionaries in the freedom struggle.

Teaching in mother tongue reflected in NEP-2020

* The prime minister has been a proponent of teaching in mother tongue, as reflected in the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. This is a marked departure from the focus mainly being on English-based education, the wheels of which were set in motion during the British time.

PM Narendra Modi pushed for self-attestation of documents

* 2014: In a bid to save the common man from hassles, Modi pushed for shifting to self-certification of documents and pitched for a minimum use of affidavits.

List of other remnants of colonial past erased by Modi government

* In 2015, Aurangzeb Road was renamed as A P J Abdul Kalam Road.

* In 2017, Dalhousie Road was renamed as Dara Shikoh Road.

* Teen Murti Chowk was renamed as Teen Murti Haifa Chowk in 2018.",Govt highlights steps taken in 8 years to free country of 'colonial mindset' - The Economic Times,9,2022

The MoU, signed during ports, shipping and waterways and Ayush minister Sarabanada Sonowal's visit to Iran, will result in training exercises of Iranian seafarers in India, said people aware of the matter. It will open new vistas of cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean Region, they said.

India is eyeing a trilateral maritime cooperation involving Iran and Oman, according to experts.

The Iranian government is ready to conclude a long-term contract with India, prioritising the development of transit of goods through the Chabahar Port. The contract will also aim at ramping up activities of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). Shipping ministry officials said this was stated during a meeting between Sonowal and Iran's roads and urban development minister Rostam Ghasemi on Sunday. Officials said progress towards firming up trade related developments was catalysed by Sonowal's meeting with Iranian vice-president Mohammad Mokhber.

Sonowal and his Iranian interlocutors discussed the possibilities of unlocking trade potential between Central Asian countries with South Asian, ASEAN and countries from the Far East such as Japan and Korea, said officials.

Our shared historical relationship has been the seedbed of Indo Iranian bilateral relationship,"" Sonowal told the Iranian side. The sustained engagement and all round efforts in the preceding years provide an ideal platform for further expansion and deepening of the bilateral relation. India remains fully committed to develop the Chabahar Port to realise the vision set during Indian PM Narendra Modi's visit to Iran in 2016.""

The minister said inauguration of the six mobile harbour cranes would act as a force multiplier for the operation of the Shahid Beheshti Port and fuel development of the Chabahar Port. The strategic role of Chabahar Port to unlock trade potential in the regional trade between Central Asia, South Asia and SouthEast Asia is huge. We are continuously working towards making the International North South Transport Corridor as the preferred route of trade between the two regions,"" he said

The port functions in close cooperation between India's IGPL and Iranian stakeholders including Iran's Port and Maritime Organisation, Iranian Customs Administration and the Chabahar Free Zone Authority, Shahid Beheshti Port.

The PM said the government is focused on ease of living and doing business, with modern infrastructure like the new complexes playing an important role. Making a point that the decades-old hutments  some of which were erstwhile stables  were spread across a large part of central Delhi, the PM said there are some who keep criticising the government's work day and night"".

Today, Delhi is progressing in line with the vision of a 'New India'. These new office complexes will now enable our military to operate in better working conditions with all modern amenities,"" he said, adding that work has been done in record time to complete the buildings.

Emphasising that the new project will increase efficiency and comfort of the military personnel, the PM said many hutments that have now been shifted were built during World War II and were originally stables meant for horses.

The point was also made by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh who said Previous buildings were in a bad shape and affecting the working conditions of our officers. Optimum utilisation of space was not done, which is why this complex has been brought up. Over 7,000 workers can be accommodated in good working conditions"".

Older cities will often contain the remnants of past intellectual frameworks that marked the evolution of the city. This is certainly true of the many Delhis that dwell within the National Capital Region. With the debates currently raging about the city's Central Vista Project (CVP) and the newly unveiled Draft Master Plan 2041, therefore, it is important to engage with the underlying philosophy of the proposed changes rather than supporting or opposing proposals based on current political preferences.

In late 17th century, Shajehanabad (ie today's Old Delhi) was a city of palaces but also of squalid slums. This reflected a feudal hierarchy culminating in the grand palace inside Red Fort. When the British built New Delhi after 1911, they envisaged a different hierarchy  that is of a global colonial empire projecting power through an outsized Viceregal Palace (now Rashtrapati Bhawan) as well as North and South Blocks. The imagery is literally of an all-powerful Empire peering down on the subjects from Raisina Hill.

During the socialist period, Delhi became a city of civil servants. This is reflected in the buildings of RK Puram and other government housing colonies, all graded by bureaucratic hierarchy. The liberalisation of the economy after 1991, then led to the boom-town of Gurgaon with its laissez faire energy but also a whiff of the robber baron developer. A similar history can be written for other Indian cities to explain how they evolved.

What is being attempted now for Delhi is to make it consciously democratic, flexible to changing needs and modernised for the 21st century. One may agree or disagree that the proposed changes will lead to this outcome, but all views need to be expressed in the overall context of these three objectives.

The first objective of the CVP and the draft master plan is to democratise public spaces by systematically opening up heritage and green areas for public enjoyment. The same idea is behind actively supporting nightlife. Democratic cities should leverage all assets to encourage human interaction. Notice how this is a break from the older approach where municipal regulation was about yahan allowed nahi hai"" (ie not allowed here). Inaugurated just two years ago, Sundar Nursery is an example of how opening out underutilised government land can make for a wonderful addition to the city.

The same thinking informs the improvements being done to the lawns along Rajpath  the gardens are being spruced up, toilets being added and so on. Contrary to some media reports, there is no mass cutting of jamun trees. Instead, inbuilt infrastructure is being laid out so that viewing stands for events like Republic Day can be set up very quickly. Today, Rajpath lawns are out of bounds for almost three months due to the annual ritual; that too during the best weather. Since stands and sound systems will now be put up easily, we will also be able to use the space for other events  sports, concerts etc. The draft master plan, similarly, proposes to develop the Yamuna river front as an interactive"" zone that preserves the flood plains while also allowing organised public access for walking, cycling and bird-watching. Again, note how this is a break from the old thinking that any activity along the Yamuna was viewed as an environmental disaster.

The second change in approach relates to adapting buildings and urban zones for evolving needs. Repurposing is done routinely in the rest of the world but a mindset of rigid master-planning makes this unduly difficult in India. Both the CVP and the draft master plan have incorporated active adaptation. North and South Blocks may be impractical for modern offices, but the beautiful buildings can be converted into international quality museums to showcase our ancient civilisation. Raisina Hill should be open for the enjoyment of the general public, and will be a big improvement on the current National Museum.

The same thinking should be applied to cities across India. Many cities have old buildings that should be turned into cultural spaces, for instance Kolkata's Writers' Building. Indeed, whole urban zones can be redeployed for new uses  Mumbai's unused port area, the derelict warehouses of Kolkata's riverfront, and Kanpur's old mills.

Finally, Delhi needs offices and other infrastructure that are fit for the 21st century. No one who has had the misfortune of working in the likes of Shastri Bhawan will object to demolishing and rebuilding the bhawans"". The so-called corridors-of-power are overrun by hanging wires, dripping air-conditioners and the stench of leaking toilets. A few senior officers may have tolerable offices but the vast majority work from dreary partitioned cabins. Many civilian and military departments operate out of tin-sheds behind North Block where they had been moved temporarily"" in the 1950s! Forget foreign investors and diplomats, it is embarrassing to invite someone from Gurgaon to most government offices.

Suggestions and criticism are always welcome, but these must be done in the context of what is being attempted. In this spirit, let me set out my own unsolicited suggestions. First, Rajpath should be permanently pedestrianised except for Republic Day. Traffic will not be affected as pedestrian underpasses, already under construction, will allow the cross roads to keep functioning. Second, the new buildings should incorporate distinctly Indian architecture and detailing, rather than generic modernist design. Urban personality matters just as much as function.

They also said that as per the proposed plan, 3,230 trees will be moved out of the Central Vista area and transplanted to the NTPC Eco Park in Badarpur after obtaining necessary clearance from the Ministry of Environment & Forest, and a permission from the Forest Department.

After all the transplantation and plantation, they said, the Central Vista area will have a net gain of 563 trees.

One of the sources said, ""1,753 new trees will be transplanted within the project sites and 2,000 new tree saplings are to be planted within Central Vista area.""

The proposed plan also includes compensatory plantation that will ensure a substantial increase in the overall green cover of the national capital, the sources said.

""A total of 36,083 tree (saplings) will be planted in the city and overall green cover will increase substantially, including 32,330 trees to be planted in the NTPC Eco Park in Badarpur as compensatory plantation,"" an official source said.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the power corridor of the country -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

The government has been facing criticism from the opposition for executing the Central Vista Redevelopment Project amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Slamming the opposition, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had on Monday said a false narrative is being created over the Central Vista redevelopment plan and asserted that it is not a ""vanity project"", but a necessity.

Under the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue which comprises Rajpath, leading from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, 48 trees are proposed to be transplanted and of them, permission has been granted for 25, including 22 Jamun trees, till date, sources said.

However, no old tree planted as per Lutyen's original plan, including Jamun trees, is proposed to be transplanted, they said.

Transplantation of the trees approved is in progress, they said.

On Sunday, the government sought to bust ""myths"" around the Central Vista project, saying that all laid down procedures have been followed.

""The cost for the PM's residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media. It is part of many projects, as mentioned earlier, whose neither the design has been approved nor the cost estimate or tendered cost has been firmed up,"" they said.

Detailed environment impact assessment has been carried out for all the 10 Buildings under the Common Central Secretariat, Common Conferencing facility, Prime Minister's Residence, Prime Minister's Office and Vice President Enclave.

""The Expert Appraisal Committee which is an independent body of field experts has examined this and recommended for clearance on May 2 this year. Environmental Clearance has been granted by MoEF&CC on May 31.

""Therefore, these statements that piecemeal approach has been taken to surmise adverse impact of this project is unfound and totally false,"" they said.

The Congress has been asking the BJP-led Union government to shelve its plans on the central vista redevelopment project and give priority to improving medical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic to save people's lives.

The government said that all the paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, collections and other significant heritage and cultural artefacts that are presently housed at the National Museum, National Archives of India and Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) are carefully preserved.

According to the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the entire project will be carried out in a heritage-sensitive manner. The existing documents and artefacts will be moved to upgraded facilities, with modern infrastructure, to ensure their longevity, it has said.

The entire exercise will be spearheaded and monitored by the Ministry of Culture, ensuring compliance to the heritage conservation guidelines.

All the relevant heritage-sensitive approvals and clearances will be obtained from Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) before initiating the project, it has said.","Central Vista area to get 1,753 new trees as transplant, revamp to raise green cover - The Economic Times",6,2021

But there's still scope for reimagining it. One important thing is missing from current plans  the Central Vista, as conceived, will lose its value as a cultural hub. It will simply be ministry offices and government departments.

Is this any way to treat the country's most valued public space?

The assertion of bureaucracy along the Central Vista can hardly be considered proof of Indian democracy. However adept the new architecture, more than ever now, we need a parallel public response that gives visible expression to cultural institutions.

The current stalemate between the government's plan for the vista and the citizen's right to a cohesive public cultural space can best be resolved by two critical intrusions.

First, there's a need for a clear-eyed assessment of the history of the Central Vista, and an examination of the 90-year-old plan itself. Meant to be colonialism's grand showpiece for the next 100 years, the empire folded within a decade, thus transforming the place quickly and conveniently into a parade ground for the new Indian republic.

Seventy years on we in India continue to celebrate our Republic Day  like North Korea, China and Russia  with a parade of military and cultural power. Meanwhile democracies like Germany, Brazil and the US have long since converted their public arenas into pedestrian cultural zones. Surrounded by the Capitol and government offices, the Washington Mall, to this day, continues to sprout museums, galleries and theatres, adding barely five years earlier, the new Museum of African American History. Public space along the Seine in Paris similarly aligns with museums and gardens.

What should happen to the Central Vista a century after Lutyens? Should it remain frozen in a colonial time or be altered to 21st century demands? Should the entire stretch be pedestrianised, and its Russian parade ground aspect erased altogether? Could in fact the Republic Day celebrations permanently move to the Red Fort?

Second, and more crucial is the cultural aspect of the Vista itself. Artists, historians, architects and many concerned citizens have expressed their apprehensions on a scheme that atomises culture into indistinct and disjointed buildings to be set in far-flung ends of the India Gate grounds.

Some argue that so damaging is the current plan to move India's cultural relics, it is hard to believe that a government could wantonly neglect and disparage its own invaluable history. Rare artifacts and manuscripts, ancient sculpture and precious jewellery  currently with the National Museum, the National Archives, the Archaeological Survey and the IGNCA  will be moved to separate temporary locations in the city and to Noida. These include fragile items like leaf and papyrus manuscripts requiring special casings and temperature control; others, like heavy Pallava stone sculptures, need special hoists.

How such complex material is handled is a matter of serious concern. Institutional dismemberment is catastrophic for any form of ancient history that is already poorly catalogued, stored and displayed, and could now even be lost or damaged in transit.

Again, let's note that the Central Vista plan is a given. A new parliament house will be built, along with a new prime minister's home. For two years or more, trees will be cut, dust will rise, and a new cityscape will appear on parallel roads on far sides of the Vista.

But the central flank remains an unresolved question. What should happen in the wide stretch between Rashtrapati Bhavan and around India Gate? As national museums, archives and arts centres are erased from the bureaucratic map a new place needs to be found for them. A place that does not alter the original Lutyens plan, nor displaces the government's current proposal.

The more productive approach now demands that we stop harping on what the Central Vista once was, nor bemoan what it soon will be  both are known  but rather, dwell on what it could become. The place requires paradoxically both, historic conservation, as well as a contemporary vision.

A reinvention that moves beyond the political debates and creates a comprehensive cultural track containing contiguous galleries, museums, theatres, music halls, archival and library structures. The possibilities are endless, and must be open to examination and architectural challenge.

After all the hectoring, the recriminations and uncertainty  there must be a cause for optimism and perhaps even a happy ending.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is likely to take up construction of the new PM Residence (PMR) in Aug, which marks a slight delay on earlier plans, after shifting offices in hutments at Dalhousie Road near South Block, to the two new office buildings in Africa Avenue and K G Marg.

As per the master plan submitted to the expert appraisal committee for environment clearance, which has received the go ahead, the PMR will come up on 15 acres and will have 10 low rise buildings of not more than two floors. The PMR will not have any basement, according to the CPWD's proposal. Sources said the PMR will be a complete complex for the PM's residence and PMO. TOI on Nov 3, 2019 had first reported new PMO and PMR coming closer to South Block.

According to the plan, the PMR complex will have a facility for parking 112 vehicles and will accommodate around 1,000 employees. The daily floating population is estimated to be 500. The SPG building for PM's security will come up close to PMR on a 2.5 acre plot. There will be only one building with a basement. It will have parking space for 175 vehicles. CPWD had not submitted the details of the budget to be spent for PMR while the total project cost for the Central Vista redevelopment is Rs 13,400 crore. This excludes the cost of Parliament and redevelopment of Rajpath.



Though CPWD had proposed to complete the PMR and SPG building by Dec in its proposal submitted in Jan this year, the work plan has been delayed due to the second wave of Covid. There was a plan to complete the two new buildings in Africa Avenue and K G Marg by Apr-May and hence existing offices in hutments could be shifted for the construction of PMR. But these have been delayed and we expect shifting of offices may start by Aug and the bids for construction of PMR and SPG building can be floated by then,"" said a source.

A new PMR is part of the mega revamp of the Central Vista area in Central Delhi. The government has already floated a tender for the first three office buildings that will come up on IGNCA plot. These buildings will have modern facilities including centralised air-conditioning, IT-based building management and basement parking system, and total management of solid and liquid waste within the campus. Each building will have 24 large conference halls to accommodate 40-45 people, a library, pharmacy, creche and music room besides gymnasium and yoga centre.

According to the overall plan of these office buildings, PMR, VP Enclave and a mega conference hall, the total number of 4,642 existing trees will be reduced to 3,165. The CPWD has submitted that 30,547 trees will be planted as compensatory afforestation in other parts of the city.",Central Vista Project: Construction of new PM residence likely to begin in Aug after slight delay caused by pandemic,5,2021

Asserting that the winter session of Parliament in Dec next year will take place in the new Parliament building and the Republic Day parade next year will be held at the refashioned Central Vista avenue on the 75th anniversary of Independence, sources in the government on Friday said there was no either-or"" choice between the projects and the budget for Covid management.

Reacting to the opposition's attacks against the government for going ahead with the two projects, sources said the parties, mainly Congress, were spreading false propaganda about Central Vista of which the under-construction projects were small parts, being developed at a cost of barely Rs 1,300 crore. MLAs bungalows in Mumbai are being constructed for Rs 900 crore whereas the new Parliament building and the Central Vista avenue together will cost Rs 1,300 crore,"" an official said.

Besides, tenders for the two projects were awarded in pre-Covid times, the official said. The remaining projects under Central Vista redevelopment will be taken up later as the entire project has to be completed over an extended period. Sources said over 400 workers were deployed at the two project sites where Covid-19 protocol is being complied with strictly. A senior functionary said the opposition was demanding to stop the Central Vista project, which in reality had not even started.

Congress's criticism was premised on the party's think-tank AICC Research Department, which had made hypothetical observations about the project, the official said.

He added that the actual cost of the project would be clear only after tenders were awarded but initial assessment was that the whole Central Vista, comprising 13 buildings including a centralised secretariat, bungalows for the prime minister and the vice president, would cost approximately Rs 17,000 crore.

The project, which is estimated to be completed by 2026, is being executed by the housing and urban affairs ministry. Several opposition parties recently wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking him to start free vaccination for all and stop the Central Vista project.

Urban development minister Hardeep Singh Puri has defended the project. Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination. India's healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs 3 lakh crore.

The ""intentions and motive"" behind filing of the plea are evident from the fact that the instant project has been singled out by the petitioners despite several other agencies, including Delhi Metro, carrying out construction activities across the national capital, the Centre has alleged.

""The very fact that out of all these construction activities going on simultaneously for different projects by different agencies, the petitioner has chosen to be a public spirited citizen only with regard to one project only speaks volumes about his intentions and motive behind filing the present petition,"" the Centre's affidavit has contended.

Since the affidavit was not yet on record, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh listed the matter for hearing on May 12.

The court also allowed the early hearing application moved by the petitioners -- Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film maker -- who have contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.

In the affidavit filed in the court on May 10, the central government has said that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted construction activities, during the prevailing curfew, where the labourers are residing on-site.

It has said the workers were engaged well before the imposition of curfew on Apr 19.

""It is submitted that in the meantime, a COVID compliant facility was installed at the worksite itself, to accommodate the 250 workers who had expressed their willingness to stay put and continue the aforesaid work.

""The facility provides for strict implementation of COVID protocol strictly and also adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour, such as sanitization, thermal screening, physical/social distancing and masking,"" the government has said in its affidavit.

It has also said that the contractor has provided health insurance to all the concerned workers against COVID-19 and a separate facility for conducting the RT-PCR test, isolation and medical aid has also been set up at the site.

""It is unequivocally stated that the workers working on the project as of now, are residing at the work site, following social distancing norms as well as other COVID-19 protocols.

""It is false to suggest that any workers are brought from Sarai Kale Khan camp to the working site on a daily basis or otherwise and consequently, the entire substratum of the case of the petitioners is erroneous and based on falsehood,"" the government has said.

The high court on May 4 had adjourned the matter to May 17 saying it first wants to study the apex court's Jan 5 judgement giving a go ahead to the Central Vista project.

Thereafter, the petitioners had moved the apex court against the high court's May 4 order,

In the hearing before the apex court, they had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.

Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,"" they had told the apex court.

The apex court had declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the high court.

It asked the petitioners to seek an early hearing before the high court and subsequently, they moved an application to advance the matter.

The petitioners have claimed before the high court that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.

Their plea has also contended that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the ""crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.

The very purpose of the petition is to seek a direction to the Respondents to forthwith, stop back and forth movement of workers by buses from Sarai Kale Khan, Karol Bagh, Kirti Nagar and other areas around Delhi (where they reside with their families) to the site of the construction activity at the 'Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project' during the subsistence of this peak phase of the pandemic in New Delhi, when oxygen is in short supply and the healthcare system is in total collapse,"" the PIL had said.

The apex court was hearing the appeal against the May 4 order of the high court which had listed the PIL for hearing on May 17 saying it wants to first go through what the Supreme Court has deliberated in its judgement of Jan 5, giving a go ahead to the ambitious project.

The apex court today asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra to mention the matter before the High Court for urgent listing on May 10.

We are of the opinion that since the matter is pending before the High Court and the order challenged in the special leave petition is only of adjournment, we are not inclined to go into the merit of the case,"" a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshari said.

It said that in given circumstances, we request Mr. Luthra to file the petition himself or through any other counsel, to make a request before Delhi High Court on Monday (May 10) to take up the matter as early as possible"".

It noted the submission of the senior advocate that the matter involves extreme urgency and said that the High Court may consider the prayer and pass orders.

At the outset, Luthra told the bench that the matter is of extreme importance as the country is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

He said they are only concerned with the challenge to the permission granted for continuation of construction which is going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.

Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Raj Path and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,"" Luthra said.

He referred to the letter written by Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for continuation of construction work in Central Vista project on the ground that it is time bound work.

The permission was granted on the ground that it was essential activity. How is construction work an essential activity? In a health emergency, we cannot risk the lives of workers and their families and put more pressure on health care system,"" Luthra said adding that peak of second wave of COVID-19 is being anticipated by May 15 and High Court has listed the matter for May 17, which would not serve any purpose.

He said that when the nation is considering lockdown and even Indian Premier League is being shut, the construction activity cannot be allowed.

Justice Saran said, When we are sitting in closed rooms with face masks, itself shows the situation is grim. We would not like to make any further comments on the COVID situation as other benches are seized of the matter, otherwise our remarks may be misinterpreted"".

The top court disposed of the plea.

The High Court has deferred the hearing on a PIL which had sought direction to Centre to halt construction work at the Central project due to prevailing COVID situation.

Petitioners Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, have claimed that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.

They have said before the High Court that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the ""crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, has said.

The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.",SC refuses to entertain plea for hearing on PIL for halting construction in Central Vista project - The Economic Times,5,2021

The submission was made in response to a petition challenging the change in land use of a plot where the new official residences of the Vice-President and the Prime Minister are stipulated as part of the ambitious Central Vista project in Lutyens' Delhi.

The Centre also told the top court that all the ministries will be relocated in the Common Central Secretariat buildings which are being developed on of the Rajpath.

""It is submitted that the Respondents are cognizant of the public nature of the projects and specifically seek to add various public facilities to the larger vision plan and have suo motu created a lot of space for recreational purposes. It is submitted that there are both qualitative and quantitative increases in public spaces in larger vision.

""For example, North and South Blocks which cover nearly 27 acres and are proposed to be converted into National Museums showcasing 'India in making' prehistoric to present date. The museums will be open to the public at large and serve important public purposes,"" the affidavit said.

The affidavit stated that the area of Plot No.1 is currently being used as government offices for almost 90 years now and no recreational activity (neighbourhood play area) exists as per actual ground conditions on Plot no. 1.

""It is also averred that the place has not ever been open for the general public to utilise it for any public recreational purposes. It is also submitted that there is no residing population or residential colony in the said vicinity and only the office premises of Ministry of Defence are functioning in the said area. Hence, 'Neighbourhood play area' was not in existence [nor is required], and is not therefore required to be in de-jure mentioned in the Master Plan,"" the affidavit said.

In its consolidated reply, the Centre said considering the overall public purpose of the Central Vista and the overall vision behind the same, it has compensated and increased various public areas for the purpose of recreation and added numerous facilities in the overall Master Plan of Central Vista Project which shall be public amenities, over and above the existing ones, for the larger benefit of the public.

The affidavit said that precious pieces of land on the Vista are highly under-utilised and these structures mostly house Defence establishments, with some offices of other Ministries.

""Defence offices complexes i.e. buildings for Defence Offices have been constructed at Africa Avenue and KG Marg and the process of their shifting has already commenced.

The affidavit stated that the petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential is misconceived and liable to be dismissed with costs.

The Central Vista revamp, announced in Sep 2019, envisages a new triangular Parliament building with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

In Jan this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.

The top court's verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.

That it is a vanity project, which means the government is spending money where it is not required. We do not know where this figure of 20,000 crore is coming from.

Its national image and the reputation of its government has been battered. The country has even been taunted as a 'failed state' by the punditry.

First, there was the second wave of Covid-19 that resulted in thousands of untimely deaths. Apart from the large numbers who are reduced to faceless statistics in natural disasters and epidemics, these now include Indians from elite and middle-class families. In short, people we either know or know about.

Initially, there were severe shortages of oxygen cylinders for Covid patients. Although this was eventually managed, and in a short time, there were subsequent hiccups associated with the demand for anti-Covid vaccinations far exceeding supply. Although in absolute terms, 195 million Indians had received at least one jab by May 25 "" second only to the United States "" this accounted for merely 3.1% of the population, suggesting a long haul ahead.

In democratic societies, there is a tendency to pillory the government for anything short of super-efficiency in crisis management. Since the mainstream media is dominated by those whose inclinations are visibly Left-liberal and, increasingly, woke, the quantum of disquiet tends to be amplified in the case of governments with different orientations.

President Donald Trump was, of course, the biggest casualty of this phenomenon although, to be fair, the bigoted denial of Covid by some of his pig-headed supporters made his administration a delicious target.

In Britain, where, after a period of hesitation and confusion, the Boris Johnson government moved resolutely to vaccinate as many as possible, the criticisms have not waned. Yet, as local body polls and parliamentary by-elections have shown, there is a striking mismatch between carping media voices and the popular mood. This may not be a universal principle, but it does suggest that the loudest voices may not be the most representative ones "" as was demonstrated during the 2016 demonetisation.

In India, Covid-19 management hasn't yet become an electoral issue but if the media narrative is any indication, the impression is being fostered that Narendra Modi's government has made an almighty mess and forfeited its moral right to rule. From conjuring imagery reminiscent of the 1943 Bengal famine to suggestions of ineptitude at all levels, it is being gleefully suggested that India is back to the days when its sufferings sustained the West's sense of cultural superiority. The emergency medical assistance from overseas has been held up as proof of the demise of Modi's Atmanirbhar Bharat aspirations.

To the accusations of faltering in the face of the second wave, has been added the fulminations over the Central Vista project in Delhi. The exercise has been described as 'tasteless', a show of 'vanity' and an example of arrogance and misplaced priorities. Aesthetics has been added to the anti-Modi grudges.

Finally, the Indian government's spat with Twitter, Facebook and other transnational companies over adherence to domestic norms has been presented as evidence of authoritarian impulses and a threat to basic freedoms.

The three very different issues have coalesced in a larger political operation "" to secure the political defeat of Modi in 2024, with next year's Uttar Pradesh election as the curtain-raiser.

It is not a coincidence that most of the social media stalwarts who have been fulminating about Modi having lost the plot are those who were loudest in warning India against him in 2014. The global 'woke' fraternity has been egged on to disregard national sovereignty on the ground that a conflict will erode foreign investor confidence. The anti-Modi battles have been cheered on by Indian academics overseas who feel exiled from the power structure in New Delhi.

Confronted with this assault, it would be wrong for the government to develop a siege mentality. The Modi government has hitherto been on top of the game by focussing single-mindedly on governance and capacity building. This must not change. Perceptions are important, but at the end of the day they depend almost entirely on the lived experiences of ordinary people and not on who screams the loudest. What is, however, also necessary is clarity over policy, complete sincerity of purpose, a willingness to engage with the larger public and, above all, humility. Mistakes must be admitted and rectified.

It was only to be expected that the ousted Old Establishment would leave no stone unturned""including cynical alliances with foreign entities "" to attempt a comeback. They will have to be determinedly countered with imagination, sobriety, and exemplary performance.

On Mar 24, 2020, with little known about the method of infection, prevention, control and cure for the disease, India announced a nationwide lockdown of 21 days that eventually lasted until May 31, 2020, before ending in stages. Cost of that lockdown was steep but necessary. But it became apparent as we learnt more about the virus and its behaviour that a hyper-local approach to control the spread of the infection could be equally if not more effective while having far less impact on economic activity and livelihoods than a countrywide lockdown.

By the end of the first wave it was apparent that in this vast and diverse country, different states were at very different stages of the pandemic, their state of preparedness, and their balance between lives and livelihoods. Forcing enterprises that were located in unaffected districts to close was an inferior option to letting states determine their local strategies for dealing with the virus.

The double-digit growth of bank deposits compared to less than 5% growth in non-food credit from commercial banks reflects weak demand sentiments. Capacity utilisation in industry is still at less than 70%, far below the 80% threshold believed to trigger a self-reinforcing virtuous investment cycle. Growth impulses from cash transfers, which are not substantial and prolonged, would be short-lived, leaving India with even higher general government debt without any sustainable benefits.

India instead eschewed the path of reckless fiscal expansion and chose to focus on improving the productive capacity of the economy through expenditures on sectors with relatively higher economic multiplier impact and employment generation potential that will also make India's economy more globally competitive.

Construction of infrastructure and real estate create about five times the jobs for the money spent relative to the number of jobs generated per unit of investment in other sectors of the economy. The largest enterprises in these sectors have the capacity to minimise the spread of infections among their workforce. To support economic growth by improving India's global competitiveness in manufacturing and services and generating livelihoods, it would be advisable to accelerate investment in infrastructure, logistics and improve the building stock in the country including the rejuvenation and regeneration of urban space.

The argument that the resources for construction or infrastructure can just be alternately invested in hospitals is fallacious. India definitely needs more and better hospitals. But these outlays have to go hand in hand with the much slower cycle of producing the required number of health service professionals. It is worth noting that the government has accorded special attention to the healthcare sector, increasing overall outlay to health and wellbeing by more than 135% over last year. Since 2014, the number of AIIMS campuses have grown 267% from six to 22, medical colleges have grown 48% from 381 to 565, with undergraduate seats growing 58% from 54,348 to 85,726 and postgraduate seats growing 80% from 30,191 to 54,275. The pace of expansion of numbers of healthcare professionals is unprecedented in the country's history.

The argument that construction or infrastructure spending takes away from providing for oxygen, drugs or vaccinations, is also fallacious. There is unspent allocation reflecting bottlenecks including supply, coordination, and execution at various levels.

Last Oct for example, the Centre ordered 162 oxygen plants for public health facilities in states to be delivered in 2020 although daily infections were already declining. By mid-Apr only 33 were installed, but the initial orders were more than tripled last month. Clearly the constraints are other than financial resources. It is worth re-emphasising that measures to counter the pandemic have not faced even the slightest financial constraint at any point of time.

Assertions that the redevelopment of the Central Vista of New Delhi is taking away resources from pressing concerns like healthcare and pollution for a vanity project are therefore misplaced and indeed mal-intentioned. The project for the redevelopment of urban spaces in Delhi started well before the start of the pandemic. To slow down these projects midway or stop them completely, when the economy needs the jobs and demand created by these public expenditures, would indeed be a travesty. This is especially true when well-reputed companies, which are in charge of these projects, have the demonstrated capacity to minimise the spread of infections.

The consolidation of central ministries and departments in a single location will surely improve the functioning efficiency of and between the currently disparately spread central government ministries. By better connecting the offices to shared transportation at high frequency will save time, reduce road congestion, and lower pollution. Those who visit the various bhawans today realise these buildings are well past their expiry date, especially if one takes into account the needs for energy efficiency and need for ergonomically designed work spaces. Most of these office buildings have over the years become a patchwork of ugly retrofitting and extensions.

Efforts to slow the pace of re-acceleration in infections and addressing the fallout, are taking the attention of the whole of the government. Simultaneously, timely completion of infrastructure and building projects in India will go a long way in bringing down India's cost of capital, recycle capital faster, and accelerate the pace of growth and employment generation of our economy. Continuing infrastructure and large building projects along with maintaining appropriate measures to prevent the spread of infections will help return our economy to health earlier.

Claiming that the Covid-19 pandemic has turned into an ""apocalyptic human tragedy"" in the country, the opposition leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi and some chief ministers, also demanded the Centre provide food grains to the needy, and give Rs 6,000 per month to all the jobless people.

In their joint letter in which they make nine suggestions to the government, the leaders have also demanded a repeal of the three Central farm laws which, they claimed, will help protect lakhs of 'annadatas' (food-growers) from becoming the victims of pandemic.

A large number of farmers are sitting in protest at three borders of Delhi, seeking the farm laws passed by Parliament in Sep last year be scrapped.

Apart from Congress president Gandhi, the signatories include former prime minister and JDS leader H D Deve Gowda, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, chief ministers Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), Mamata Banerjee (TMC), MK Stalin (DMK), and Hemant Soren (JMM).

Former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah (NC) and Akhilesh Yadav (SP) have also signed the letter, alongside Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), D Raja (CPI) and Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M).

The leaders have said the Covid-19 pandemic has assumed unprecedented dimensions of a human catastrophe in the country. They noted that they have in the past also suggested to the government the measures they believed were ""absolutely imperative"" for the Centre to implement to arrest the situation.

""Unfortunately, your government has either ignored or refused all these suggestions. This only compounded the situation to reach such an apocalyptic human tragedy,"" they said.

Without going into all the ""acts of commission and omission"" by the Central government that have brought the country to such a ""tragic pass"", the opposition leaders demanded that the new measures suggested by them must be undertaken on a war footing.

""Procure vaccines centrally from all available sources - global and domestic. Immediately begin a free, universal mass vaccination campaign across the country. Invoke compulsory licensing to expand domestic vaccine production. Spend budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crores for the vaccines,"" the leaders said in their letter.

""Stop Central Vista construction. Use the allocated money for procuring oxygen and vaccines, instead. Release all money held in the unaccounted private trust fund, PM Cares to buy more vaccines, Oxygen and medical equipment required,"" they also told the prime minister.

The opposition leaders also demanded giving all jobless at least Rs 6,000 per month and a free distribution of foodgrains to the needy, saying over one crore tonnes of foodgrains are currently ""rotting in central godowns"".

""Repeal farm laws to protect lakhs of our annadatas becoming victims of the pandemic so that they can continue to produce food to feed the Indian people,"" they said.

""Though it has not been the practice of your office or government, we would appreciate a response to our suggestions in the interests of India and our people,"" the leaders said in the letter.

The letter comes on a day India witnessed a record rise in Covid-19 deaths with 4,205 fresh fatalities taking the overall toll to 2,54,197, while 3,48,421 new coronavirus infections were also reported.

The accusation comes hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the Narendra Modi government for executing the project, terming it a ""criminal wastage"", while asking the dispensation to focus on people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India's healthcare budget for just this year was over 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities,"" Puri tweeted.

In a series of tweets, the Union housing and urban affairs minister, whose ministry is executing the government's ambitious project, said the Central Vista is not a new project and alleged that during the UPA government, Congress leaders had written about the need for a new parliament.

""Congress doesn't stop at hypocrisy. Look at their shameful double face. During UPA, Congress leaders wrote about the need for a new parliament. The Speaker in 2012 wrote a letter to Urban Development Ministry for the same. And now they have the gall to oppose the same project?,"" he said.

""They want to distract people from monumental governance failures in their states by spreading lies. So they indulge in cheap politics despite knowing this project creates direct & indirect employment for thousands of skilled, semi-skilled & unskilled workers in these times,"" he alleged in another tweet.

Puri also accused the Congress and its allies of splurging on reconstructing an MLA hostel in Maharashtra and building a new Legislative Assembly building in Chhattisgarh, adding that ""If this is fine, what is the problem with Central Vista?.""

Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged in a tweet: ""Central Vista is criminal wastage. Put people's lives at the centre- not your blind arrogance to get a new house!.""

Puri said there are hundreds of projects being executed by various departments and added that governance has not come to a standstill, unlike the Congress's times of policy paralysis.

""...Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It's only the Congress that's obsessed about it, nobody else."" Puri said.

Besides the new Parliament building, the redevelopment of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor - envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's Residence and Prime Minister's Office, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

In a letter, the board has provided options for the building and asked the RVNL to come up with two different plans for renovation of the Rail Bhawan -- one with cost estimate and timelines for renovation in a phased manner while the office is in working mode and another with cost estimate and timelines for complete renovation in one go with an alternative arrangement for Rail Bhawan office till such time of renovation.

With just five months left to meet the deadline, efforts are underway to make the new Parliament building functional by Nov this year. The new parliament building is expected to have two major galleries -- one showcasing the history of the constitution, and the other one on Indian arts, architecture, science and history.

Acclaimed artist Vasudev Kamath, known for his descriptive paintings on mythological and historical subjects, will advise the government on the ceremonial foyers in the new parliament building.

The move is part of the government's larger plan to bring the country's 37 state legislatures-31 Assemblies and six Councils-on to a single digital platform which will have enabling provisions for the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. ET has learnt that at least 20 state legislatures are already on board with the idea.

A single, process-based, end-to-end digital platform called National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) has been developed for the parliamentary affairs ministry. It is one of the 44 'Mission Mode' projects to be implemented under the government's flagship ''.

While the comprehensive project has taken off in several states, it is likely to be implemented next in the new Parliament building, which is coming up under the Central Vista redevelopment project. The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has set an Oct 2022 deadline for the building's completion.

An official said the software will bring ""synergy in the working and dissemination of information by all legislatures..."" on the single platform, breaking silos.

""All legislatures are proposed to be linked together so that on one platform, the public at large can see what is happening in all 39 legislative houses across the country,"" he said.

Once implemented, the new e-platform will enable members to seek divisions whenever they want, and also cast their votes digitally from anywhere within the Houses, ET has learnt.

While members will be able to make submissions digitally, notices can be sent anytime from anywhere, approved and processed online in the legislature secretariats.

Designed and developed by state-run National Informatics Centre (NIC), the platform, under the parliamentary affairs minister, will eventually replace the nearly 100 existing IT-related systems across legislatures.

A touchscreen device will be provided to every member inside the House that will contain the list of businesses, papers to be laid, Bills, consideration and passing, committee reports, questions and answers, bulletins, synopsis of proceedings, digital library, notices and members directory, apart from providing visual display of House proceedings.

The platform has been developed to ensure members can find everything they need in the House on one platform--their notices, replies, notifications, constitution of committee, agenda, minutes, room booking to preparation of report, and also enable them to talk to their aides and secretaries, those in know of the matter said.

While Bihar Council was the first to use NeVA to digitise its proceedings, Nagaland created history by becoming the first state Assembly to completely digitise the House, while Odisha used the same platform to present a paperless budget. The pilot project for digitisation of legislatures was made first in Himachal Pradesh.

Official sources said the ministry has contained the cost of the project to digitise all state legislatures at '673.94 crore, of which the central government's share is Rs 423.60 crore.

Minister Prahlad Joshi is spearheading the project.

As per the ministry's calculation, implementation of this platform will save the states Rs 340 crore annually which they spend on paper, printing and postage.

As with regard to the states, Punjab, Bihar (both Houses), Nagaland, Odisha, Manipur, Tamil Nadu Sikkim, Meghalaya, Haryana, Tripura, UP (both Houses) and Mizoram Assemblies have received necessary central funds for on-boarding NeVA.

The push for digitising came from the highest levels. Two years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged the presiding officers of all the legislative bodies, including the two Houses of Parliament, to make the functioning of the legislatures paperless by adopting single application by Aug 15, 2022.

""The platform is so simple that even those who are comfortable with only WhatsApp or Facebook or email can operate it. For this, NeVA Seva Kendras are proposed to be established for training of members and their staff, among others,"" the person quoted earlier said.","Digital India Programme: New e-enabled Parliament, Assemblies to work on unified digital infra - The Economic Times",5,2022

The next step is relocation of offices in 90 acres of hutments. During the stage of building a new central secretariat complex, some of the buildings will be demolished, Puri said, adding that not a single historical or iconic building will be removed.

The idea is to bring all offices in the central secretariat complex which will have space for 50,000 people working and connected through an underground shuttle tunnel so that transportation is very easy, he noted.

Puri, however, expressed hope that some state governments will draw inspiration and take necessary steps to make sure that all government buildings, state departments and subsidiary offices are at one place.

On the usage of the old parliament building after the project is completed, he said that it will have to be repaired and made available for alternative uses.

""At this point of time, no comprehensive thought has been given to what precise use the old parliament building will be put to. Several suggestions keep coming, including that there should be an institute for democratic and parliament studies. These are merely suggestions. No decisions have been taken,"" Puri stated.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new prime minister residence and PMO, and new Vice President Enclave.

In Sep last year, Tata Projects Limited had won the tender for the construction of the new parliament building.

""We hope that the next Winter Session of parliament will be held in the new parliament building in 2022 which also happens to be the 75th year of Independence,"" he added.","Congress built 'substandard' buildings like Krishi Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan: Hardeep Singh Puri - The Economic Times",3,2021

The new Parliament building will have a triangular shape and is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022. The government plans to hold the monsoon session of Parliament in 2022 in the new building.

""The construction work of the Parliament building has started,"" an official said.

PM Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building on Dec 10 last year.

Earlier this week, a 14-member heritage panel gave its approval to the new Parliament building while also giving the go-ahead to the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to seek prior approval from the panel and other relevant authorities before starting the construction of the new building.

The construction work could not start earlier as the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decided the pending pleas on the issue.

The new building is being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd. The project is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.

Tata Projects Ltd. said despite the 35-day delay in the commencement of the construction work, it is confident that it will be able to deliver the project on or before time.

""Our plans of action are already in place to accelerate the schedule by augmenting resources like skilled manpower and formwork etc,"" said Sandeep Navlakhe, vice president and business unit head of Tata Projects Ltd.

""Our reinforcement required to be placed in the raft and walls are already made ready. Other off-site activities like procurement of stone for external cladding, MEP LLEs, carpets, etc. happened during these 35 days. We are more than confident that we will be able to deliver this building to the nation on or before time,"" he said.

The new structure will come up in front of the existing Parliament that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.

The new Parliament building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have an additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.

According to the plan, provisions will be made in furniture for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the Speaker.

Besides the new Parliament building, the redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's Residence and Prime Minister's Office, and a new Vice-President Enclave.","Centra Vista: Construction of the new Parliament building begins, set to be ready in 2022 - The Economic Times",1,2021

The practice of religion within the French constitution's right to free expression was particularly difficult to define, for it tried to balance both "" the traditions of Islamic practice and the government's ability to intervene in potential threats to public safety. The carefully worded document was vetted by legislators and Islamic scholars and was the subject of a vociferous public debate, now awaiting ratification.

Serious debate is a crying need in a country where everyone talks but no one listens. More often than not, most decisions in India on public legislation and public works are taken behind closed doors, or not taken at all. And by people who have either vested interests or no interest. Look at two recent events.

Earlier when riots broke out in several Indian cities, including Delhi, over Indian citizenship and many died, there were accusations that the police had encouraged mobs; yet there was no inquiry, no investigation into the role of the police or local politicians, or indeed how to ensure future public safety. The matter was merely treated as a public riot. By contrast, after several African-American men were killed by police officers across the US, local and federal government officials immediately began a debate on whether to replace the police with a private neighbourhood protection force. Unlike the Delhi riots, it was too important an issue to be just swept under the rug.

There has been similarly no discussion on the Central Vista project, despite its historic and iconic status. Treated like a domestic family affair, it is as if all choices of design and construction have been made at the family dining table "" without the slightest regard for public debate or consultation. This is not unusual for a government that chooses to inform the public only when convenient.

Public works of monumental scale abroad are accorded an altogether different approach. In 2019, after the Notre Dame Cathedral fire in Paris, the French government wasted no time in issuing a call for an international architectural competition to redesign the building's burnt roof. There could be no better acknowledgement that the structure belonged to the world and an open competition was the most public form of debate. The work was won by Chinese architects. Would an open competition ever be considered for the Central Vista project?

The Indian government relies on secrecy as its most expedient tool to keep the public guessing. Check out state or central government websites for any useful data, and you'd be surprised to hit anything of relevance. Almost all sites are a shameless promotion of local projects "" roads built, institutes inaugurated, a new bridge on an old river. If you require information on rural school numbers in Bihar, or the number of new wells dug in Rajasthan, it's best to seek help from local NGOs, or file a petition under the Right to Information Act.

Part of this awkward iron curtain on information and debate comes from the government's implicit view that most people in India are incapable of comprehending complex issues. They can operate a voting machine because symbols like a broom or a cricket bat can be easily identified. But ask them questions on the merits of a new parliament building, or the new farm bills, the vast majority are either ignorant or incapable, or both. One could argue that when even MPs don't deal intelligently with national issues how could you expect ordinary citizens to have a view, say on drug abuse in Punjab? Or take a stand on abortion?

It eventually boils down to a matter of leadership. If you watch the debates on the German or Mexican parliaments, or other democracies, arguments will be presented with spitfire accuracy and informed rebuttals, without the lazy buffoonery or the petulant exchanges of the Indian parliament, where MPs throw personal jibes "" and sometimes microphones "" at each other. Does this kind of childish debate need a new Rs 800-crore building?

Without debate, information or communication, the distance between government and people becomes increasingly unbridgeable. So much so, that it then falls on the Khan Market going citizens of Lutyens' Delhi, or the Cuffe Parade shopping lot of Mumbai to present any semblance of an opposing view. It may fall on the government to be more open, and to increase both, the quality of Indian education and the level of parliamentary debate, so that more informed groups from all over India can participate in its public arguments.

My position on this all along has been that we will go strictly according to the rulebook. If there are some procedures that need to be tweaked, we will happily do that,"" Puri told ANI.

""New (Parliament) building will represent the aspirations of India. The present building is 93 years old and wasn't built by the Indian elected government. It was built under colonial domination. It is a project for posterity and will celebrate our democracy,"" he said.

Puri said that the government will follow the highest standards for environmental protection in executing the project.

""The Court has said that smog towers should be integrated into the building. The minute we saw the judgement we were already in touch with our consultant,"" he added.

In a veiled attack on Congress, the Union Minister said that many people who are raising questions over the project had made the same demand in the past.

""There is a bit of confused thinking and selected amnesia. Many people who are questioning the project now were demanding the new Parliament when they were in power. In 2012, a Rajya Sabha MP in an interview clearly asked for a new Parliament because the present one is inadequate, not functional. The OSD to the Speaker Meera Kumar has written a letter to Secretary, Urban Development giving exactly the same reasons which this government has been citing on the need of a new Parliament... The demand is there from 2012,"" he said.

Puri said that the present Parliament is too small and it is in a state of advanced disrepair.

""Things are falling. It is no longer safe. It used to be in seismic zone 2. Today it is in seismic zone 4. Therefore we need to build a new Parliament. The new building will be there for the next 200 or 250 years. Therefore, this will be a symbol of the aspirations of new India,"" he said.

Pronouncing the judgement by a majority, the Supreme Court this morning gave its go-ahead for the construction of the new Central Vista project in the national capital. The Apex Court did not find any infirmity in the grant of approval and modifications in the change of land use.

The Apex Court said in its judgement that heritage conservation committee approval is needed when construction work is to begin and directed the project proponents to get approval from the heritage committee.

There are a number of petitions challenging the construction of the Central Vista Project at the Lutyen's zone, alleging certain violations, including change in land use and environmental compliances.

Earlier, the Supreme Court on Dec 7 had allowed the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new Parliament building on Dec 10 but directed that no construction should take place.

While the majority order said there was no infirmity"" in any of the clearances granted to the government plan, all the three judges found nothing wrong in the award of the contract for the project.

The revamp would cover a 3-km stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in New Delhi, and include the new parliament building which will be integrated with the existing one, and a common central secretariat.

The bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar gave the ruling on two public interest litigations that challenged the project over allegedly improper environmental and heritage clearances and a change in land use, among other counts. While Justices Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari gave the majority verdict, Justice Sanjiv Khanna delivered a dissenting judgement.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently laid the foundation stone for the new parliament building, which is expected to cost more than Rs 900 crore to build and be ready by Aug 2022 when the country celebrates its 75th Independence year. The court had allowed the foundation stone laying event at the time while saying that no further work should commence until it gave the final order.

We hold that there is no infirmity in the grant of no objection by the Central Vista Committee, approval by the Delhi Urban Art Commission and prior approval by the Heritage Conservation Committee,"" the bench said in the majority decision.

It did not find any fault with the change in land use, too. All relevant material had been considered and there was due application of mind at every stage, it said. The environmental clearance by the expert appraisal committee is just, proper and in accordance with law, it said.

In the present case, the respondents have elaborately demonstrated the imminent need for the project,"" the court said.

The change in land use does not result in any deprivation of recreational spaces, it noted. On the contrary, the changes would result in optimisation and greater access to open spaces including entail in asset creation,"" the bench said. The respondents have repeatedly assured the court of adhering to all norms and conditions necessary for preservation of environment and heritage including urban aesthetics.""

In his dissenting judgement, Justice Khanna agreed with the majority on the award of the consultancy and the order of the Urban Arts Commission. He, however, spoke up for the right of the citizenry to have a say in the project and their right to know all relevant information regarding it.

Approval of the heritage committee ought to have been taken prior to the project being cleared, he said. There is no empirical data in support of the assertion that the Parliament house has outlived its life, he noted.

Can't guide on moral ethical matters: SC

Justifying the decision, the majority order said the court could not venture into territories that were way beyond the contemplated powers of a constitutional court even though the petitioners claiming to be public spirited persons, had enthusiastically called upon us to do so"".

""We are compelled to wonder if we  can dictate the government to desist from spending money on one project and instead use it for something else, or if we can ask the government to run their offices only from areas decided by this court, or if we can question the wisdom of the government in focusing on a particular direction of development,"" it said.

The court asked whether it can jump to put a full stop on execution of policy matters in the first instance without a demonstration of irreparable loss or urgent necessity, or if we can guide the government on moral or ethical matters without any legal basis  we should be loath to venture into these areas"".

It said: ""We need to say this because in the recent past, the route of public/social interest litigation is being increasingly invoked to call upon the court to examine pure concerns of policy and sorts of generalised grievances against the system.""

While it said the courts were in no doubt repositories of immense public trust"" it was equally important to realise that courts operated within the boundaries defined by the Constitution and cannot be called upon to govern. For, we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise""

The constitutionally envisaged system of checks and balances"" has been completely misapplied in this case, it said. Political issues including development policies of the government must be debated in Parliament to which it is accountable, it said, adding: The role of the court is limited to examining constitutionality including legality of policy and government actions.""

""The right to development is a basic human right and no organ of the state is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law,"" it said.

As long as there is fair play in government action, it is no one's concern to assail a commercial transaction by levelling vague and unsubstantiated allegations. The genesis of a public interest litigation lies in public interest; and public interest lies in vindicating the rights of those who lack the wherewithal to reach the court to remedy injustice against them,"" said Justice A M Khanwilkar, writing the 432-page majority verdict for himself and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari.

Judicial time is not meant for undertaking a roving enquiry or to adjudicate upon unsubstantiated flaws or shortcoming in policy matters of government of the day and politicise the same to appease the dissenting group of citizens  be it in the guise of civil society or a political outfit,"" he said.

The apex court said that tool of PIL or 'social interest litigation', as it is more appropriately called, was devised to open the doors of constitutional courts for remedying glaring injustices and for securing constitutional rights.

We need to say so because we had to spend considerable time and energy on this matter (lest the petitioners entertain a feeling of having been denied a fair opportunity), despite the pandemic situation, which at the end, we find to be devoid of substance,"" it said.

The verdict was delivered on a batch of petitions, which have questioned several aspects including the environmental clearance (EC) granted regarding the Central Vista project.

The top court held that grant of EC and the notification for change in land use for construction of new parliament building under the project was valid.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna, the third judge on the bench, wrote a dissenting judgement on aspects relating to public participation in the decision-making process and on alleged failure on the part of the authorities in taking prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) for the project.

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) took the decision in a meeting held on Dec 17, the minutes of which were uploaded on the ministry's website on Monday.

In its earlier proposal, the CPWD had not mentioned the construction of a new PMO. It had written a letter to the expert panel recently, saying that the impact of the proposed PMO will be included in the EIA report.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised its estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

""We are writing to you today to convey our dismay at the manner in which your government, and you, as its head, have chosen to completely disregard the rule of law in the matter of the Central Vista Redevelopment project. This project, from its very inception, has been marked by a degree of executive highhandedness rarely witnessed before,"" alleged the letter.

""Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the central vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,"" it further alleged.

The former civil servants also wondered what locus standi the prime minister has to lay the foundation stone of the Parliament building.

""The prime minister is the head of the executive, not of the legislature. For a building that will accommodate the two Houses of Parliament, the appropriate protocol would have been for the President of India to lay the foundation stone. This was a clear instance of breach of constitutional propriety,"" the letter alleged.

Modi had on Dec 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building.

The signatories also alleged ""brazen impropriety"" in going ahead with the construction of the new Parliament building while the matter is still sub judice.",Central vista project marked by degree of executive highhandedness: 69 ex-bureaucrats to PM - The Economic Times,12,2020

Official sources said that there is ""no question of dropping"" the proposed new Prime Minister's Office (PMO) from the Central Vista Redevelopment project, after the CPWD did not mention the same in its new proposal before an expert panel of the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

The prime minister's new residence will be built on a 15-acre plot and it will have 10 buildings and they will have ground plus three floors, the CPWD said in its proposal.

Permissible ground coverage at the prime minister's new residence would be 30,351 square metre, it stated, adding that a building for the Special Protection Group will come up on a 2.50-acre plot.

The Central Vista Redevelopment project also includes the new Vice President's Enclave which will be built on 15-acre land and will have five-storey buildings with a maximum height of 15 metres, the CPWD said in its proposal.

The VP Enclave will have 32 buildings.

Reacting to the CPWD's move to drop the proposed new Prime Minister's Office in its latest proposal, Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said that the documents submitted to the Environment Ministry do not give any justification on why some plots or offices have been excluded or why the costs have increased despite such exclusions.

""But equally important is the CPWD's answer to whether any alternatives to the present proposal were considered is a ""No"". The study of such alternatives is required to be done before seeking environment clearance,"" Kohli said.

The CPWD's proposal for terms of reference, which is a step before the environment clearance, was discussed by the Environment Ministry expert appraisal committee (EAC) on Thursday.

The EAC had approved the CPWD's proposal to construct a new Parliament Building earlier this year.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.",Central Vista: PM residence to have 10 buildings; sources say no question of dropping proposed PMO - The Economic Times,12,2020

It was a blow to federalism and the state was abdicating its duties towards the poor and the disadvantaged, they said. The leafy venues that host dozens of think tanks, NGOs and international organisations quivered with outrage and indignation.

Having been at the receiving end of the Planning Commission's politicised and often discriminatory approach, and well aware how chief ministers had to line up to bargain for budgets, Modi understood that cauterisation was the remedy. For the vast gravy train of experts and consultants who were part of a cosy ecosystem, this was a calamity. They intuitively recognised the change was not cosmetic: it was an assault on the old regime and its political ideology.

After a slow start, Niti Aayog picked up pace under its first vice-chairperson Prof Arvind Panagariya. A gifted academic capable of framing a strong intellectual response to Left-dominated policy debates, Panagariya worked with dedicated officials and talented young professionals on a new medical regulator, Aadhaar and financial inclusion, education policy and reforms in agriculture. Thereafter, the Aayog helmed Ayushman Bharat and is a key part of the team driving India's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The opposition to the Central Vista project largely reflects a similar sense of displacement and dispossession. This time the ouster is more tangible. The physical architecture of government is being refashioned in sync with a changed political reality, and a form and vision of governance that is a radical departure from the past. The uprooting of the heavy grey masonry (coated with a DDA shade of yellow) is a transmogrification, causing a deep trauma to those who correctly suspect the reordering will further embed the post-2014 changes.

As with most other discussions, the debate is essentially politicised. On the one hand, it echoes the annoyance of high priests of a certain sensibility who for long assumed a primacy in deciding the country's aesthetics. The apron strings of this lot were tied with political mentors for whom they designed appropriate cultural spectacles that meshed with the prevailing political consensus. The idea was to set up a convenient and lucrative symbiotic system "" ideological endorsement for political patronage. The fury of scorned punditry can be a sight to behold.

The truth is that the buildings the redevelopment aims to replace are plain ugly. No leap of imagination can transform unlovely bhavans"" with stinky loos (things have improved but you would not use them unless you had to), cheap panelling concealing layers of electric wiring and coolers and air conditioners that stick out like warts into heritage"" of any sort. Buildings that came up in fits and starts can't really qualify on this score. A warren of crowded offices, the spaces are fundamentally ill-designed "" a decent sized conference table barely leaves space for people to shuffle around.

The look and fa�ade of Shastri Bhavan and its sibling bhavans is a throwback to Soviet-style architecture that can be seen to this day in East Europe and Russian cities. The resemblance is uncanny and the clunky look very much mirrored the dominant political paradigm of the time. India's rulers after Independence, right up to the 1990s, were deeply wedded to a socialist worldview that saw them adopt Soviet-style five-year plans, economic thinking that prioritised regulation and controls and a societal vision enshrining Marxist scholarship in academic curriculums.

Every nation has the right to create its modern monuments. Nothing is frozen in time, and no truth is immutable. Fears have been expressed that the re-modelling that includes a new Parliament building is a Hindutva"" project. The designs made public so far indicate modern architecture. Doubts on grounds of environment are important and must be considered, though it may be worth assessing how much emissions can be reduced by replacing the highly energy inefficient bhavans. Angst over wasteful"" spending in the time of a pandemic is intriguing.

Economists who are compatriots of the objectors"" are busy demanding that the government borrow and spend more. Surely, the massive Central Vista project will help create jobs and provide business. And it will be a lasting asset. A significant way in which Modi differs from previous BJP leaders is that he has not the slightest desire to court or seek approval of the Lutyens crowd. This is likely to remain unchanged, ensuring continuing strife with a tenacious, if sidelined elite. The concrete imposition in the heart of Delhi should have been atomised long ago. It is best to let it slide into history without further ado.","View: In a new Central Vista, let old stinky bhawans become history - The Economic Times",12,2020

At the Expenditure Finance Committee/Public Investment Board meeting held on Oct 20, the ministry informed it was proposed to start work from Feb 1, 2021  that is, immediately after the Republic Day Celebrations 2021 so that the work can be completed before Republic Day Celebrations in Jan 2022"".

While the expenditure involved for the Republic Day parade cannot be quantified as yet, the ministry said after the implementation of this project, the time required for making arrangements for Republic Day will come down by a month.

The entire project will be completed in 15 months (3 months for planning and 12 months for execution). As per their timeline, tenders were to be awarded in the third week of Oct.

The project is currently caught in a Supreme Court hearing and also awaits full environmental clearance, no objection certificates from the , Heritage Conservation Committee, Delhi Fire Service, Delhi Urban Arts Commission, and the Forest department.

The redevelopment will involve an expenditure of Rs 608 crore and the urban affairs ministry proposes to meet it from its own budget grants as envisaged in the revised estimate for 2020-21 & budget estimate for 2021-22, it has said.

According to the CPWD, the existing 2.9-km-long Central Vista Axis from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate would be extended till the proposed garden under the redevelopment project.

An official in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said a pathway connecting the existing Central Vista to the proposed garden which would be spreading over an 20.22-acre land could be part of the plan.

The project for the redevelopment of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and a revamped Rajpath.

In a statement, the ministry said the ""iconic structure"", which will come up at Nav Bharat Udyan (New India Garden) to commemorate 75th year of Indian Independence, could be a tower or sculpture with a maximum height of 134 metres.

""The iconic structure should realise the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, symbolising emerging New India with equitable growth opportunities, rooted in values of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas (with all, for everyone's development, with everyone's trust) and representing the aspiration of clean India, free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism,"" it stated.

According to the statement, the Central Vista Master Plan envisages redeveloping Central Vista as a world-class public space, restoring its grandeur as an architectural icon, housing modern facilities for efficient functioning of administration, strengthening cultural institutions and commemorating 75th year of Indian independence.

'Nav Bharat Udyan' will be open to the public and is being designed to have an iconic structure and infotainment facilities, the ministry said in the statement, adding the garden would showcase historical and cultural heritage and symbolise unity in diversity and aspirations of New India.

""The proposed iconic structure being built in Independent India should now become a new symbol of the national capital,"" it stated.

About requirements for the design, the CPWD said, ""The structure should be iconic in design and represent the national capital. For example, the India Gate erected by the British in the Central Vista in the early 20th century prominently signifies Delhi.""

""The structure should be built to last, like the Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar. It should use indigenous materials in keeping with the government's vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bhart' (self-reliant India),"" it said.

The project is expected to be completed by Aug 15, 2022.

Indian citizens and organisations would be able to apply for the competition, which have a prize of Rs 5 lakh for the winning entry.

The ministry of housing and urban affairs changed land use for a 15-acre plot to the south of Rashtrapati Bhavan and North Block. Earlier it was classified as transportation and parking under Master Plan 2021 and recreational or neighbourhood play area under the Zonal Development Plan.

This has now been changed to residential. Sources indicated that this plot would now be a part of the Central Vista redevelopment plan, which includes moving the residential complexes of Prime Minister from 7 Lok Kalyan Marg and Vice President from Maulana Azad Road to the heart of Delhi. The objectives of the project include consolidating, rationalising and synergising government functioning; refurbishing and better equipping the Central Vista Avenue; strengthening cultural institutions in the Central Vista. In Feb, land and development office of the ministry had written to the Delhi Development Authority, the prime land owning agency in Delhi which decides on land use changes.

The gazette notification came after a meticulous process under which DDA called for objections on the land use change. A board of inquiry and hearing was constituted to address the objections. DDA admitted 90 objections and suggestions. After disposing of the objections, the final land use change was notified last week.

A three-judge bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar, while reserving its verdict on the legal challenge to the new Parliament on several counts, said that there was no bar on any new building coming up in the central vista.

That no other new structure can be built in central vista is a submission we are rejecting outright. The only thing is there are regulations and we will examine if they have complied with the regulations. There is no prohibition (on constructing a new building),"" the court said,

This limits the legal challenge before the court to whether the government's plans were as per existing laws, rules and regulations without going into the constitutionality of the move.

At least two petitions, filed by Rajeev Suri and Lt Col (retired) Anuj Srivastava, had challenged the plan to build a new Parliament without a comprehensive environment impact assessment in the heritage zone and bypassing public hearings necessary for projects of this scale.

The bench, which began hearing the case on a priority basis - other cases invoking constitutional law like Article 370 and CAA/NRC are not being taken up now - completed hearing arguments from the government and the petitioners through a virtual hearing.

The government had said that a new Parliament building was required to showcase India's parliamentary history in its 75th year coinciding with the G20 summit in Delhi in 2022 and urged the court to have a quick hearing on the issue.

All petitioners can now submit further written submissions on the project which envisages creating an independent new Parliament building and a sprawling central secretariat which will house all ministries and departments without demolishing any existing heritage structure.

These include the old Parliament building, the Parliament library and annexe and part of the national archives building. The old building will be retrofitted and integrated with the new Parliament and will continue to be used on ceremonial occasions, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has said.

Speaking for the project consultant, HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, senior advocate Harish Salve said the opposition to the central vista project was designed to target the government and its functionaries rather than anything else.

He said all disclosures on the project can be had under the RTI, a stand the petitioners contested.","No bar on new building in central vista, will only check whether norms not complied: SC - The Economic Times",11,2020

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The revamp, which was announced in Sep last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that there was ""no abdication of duty"" in selection of consultant and every stakeholder participated and gave suggestions in the process.

""An argument that the government could have adopted a better process, cannot be a sufficient ground to scrap the project,"" Mehta said while opposing the pleas which have raised questions over several aspects including the environmental clearance (EC) granted to the project.

""There was no element of arbitrariness or favouritism in selection of consultant,"" he told the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna.

The solicitor general said the decision was taken by the competent authority and there is no allegation of ""colourable exercise of power"".

He said the petitioners have not shown any constitutional or statutory breach in the matter and they have only offered an alternative method, which cannot be a reason to scrap the project.

The recent trend is to involve constitutional morality and due process clause from foreign countries in every case, Mehta said.

""Due process is not contemplated by our Constitution,"" he said. ""We have our Constitution and we should not deviate from it"".

Arguments in the matter remained inconclusive and would continue on Thursday.

The Centre had told the apex court on Tuesday that the Central Vista project would ""save money"" which is paid as rent for housing Central government ministries in the national capital.

The government had said that decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in a haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.

The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by the authorities including the nod to change of land use.

Earlier, the apex court had said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be ""at their own risk"".

It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.

One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on Feb 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's Feb 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

Singh said that only those projects will be considered for foundation stone laying where acquisition and other clearances such as forest or environmental are complete.

According to the document, details like project cost, name of state and expected date of completion and inauguration have been sought.

Details such as after inauguration, any negative sentiments or protest among the public about the project, have also been sought.

For projects whose foundation will be laid, the CPWD asked officials concerned to submit information like expected date of foundation stone laying and expected date of completion of land acquisition.

The landmark has the names of soldiers inscribed on its surface.

The new imperial city was born on Dec 12, 1911, during a grand ceremonial 'Durbar' here when British monarch King George V had announced the shifting of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.

Three days later, a simple ceremony was held at the Government of India Camp where King George and Queen Mary had laid two foundation stones of the new capital city in succession. The stone blocks did not carry anything, but a simple inscription of ""15th Dec 1911"", according to archival records.

After laying of the foundation stones, the King-Emperor, said: ""It is my desire that the planning and designing of the public buildings to be erected should be considered with the greatest deliberation and care, so that the new creation may be in every way worthy of this ancient and beautiful city.""

In consonance with the vision of the king, architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker built the new capital city of the British Raj, whose grandeur and architectural splendour rivalled the best of the cities in Europe and America.

The centrepiece of this new capital was the Raisina Hill complex, housing the majestic Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) and North Block and South Block.

The city, constructed between the two World Wars and which took over 20 years to build, was inaugurated on Feb 13, 1931 by the then Viceroy Lord Irwin.

On the day of the inauguration, four iconic Dominion Columns, each made of red sandstone and topped by replica of a ship, were unveiled by Lord Irwin amid fanfare of trumpets followed by the playing of the (British) national anthem, according to the book 'Glittering Decades: New Delhi in Love and War'.

""The four columns which are the immediate purpose of our meeting today are tokens of something wider than anything which the past cities of Delhi represent,"" says the book, quoting the Viceroy's speech at the unveiling.

The columns, each a gift from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, marked a gesture of friendship and unity within the British Empire.

The official Twitter handle of Delhi Archives, went down memory lane, and also recalled the historic inauguration of 'New Delhi'.

""#TodayinHistory | The Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, inaugurated New Delhi as India's new capital on this day in 1931,"" Delhi Archives tweeted.

It also shared an archival aerial photograph of the then newly-built Secretariat buildings and Parliament House.

The foundation stone of the Parliament House -- an architectural marvel in stone, designed by Baker that is now revered as the country's seat of democracy, was laid 101 years ago on Feb 12, 1921 by the then Duke of Connaught, who had said that this landmark will stand for future generations as the ""symbol of India's rebirth to yet higher destinies"".

The circular-shaped elegant Parliament House building, originally called the 'Council House', was inaugurated on Jan 18, 1927 by Viceroy Irwin amid much fanfare.

The new imperial city, incidentally, was christened 'New Delhi' on Dec 31, 1926, by King George V, just a few years before its official inauguration.

""The meaning of imperial Delhi reached both its fullest expression as well as its fullest contradiction in Feb 1931, when the new capital was opened to the world in an inauguration that lasted a week,"" D Johnson and Richard Watson say in the book 'New Delhi: The Last Imperial City'.

The ceremony was held at the Raisina Hill, with the Viceroy's House, and North Block and South Block witnessing opulent functions to mark the occasion.

The legacy of building of New Delhi has been brought into sharp focus with the ongoing Central Vista redevelopment project and recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing ahead of the 125th birth anniversary of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose that a grand statue of Netaji will be installed in the empty canopy facing India Gate, drawing mixed reaction from urban planners, historians and other citizens.

The majestic canopy was built as a memorial to King George V after his death in 1936 and housed his iconic statue, which was removed in 1968. It was unveiled by the then Viceroy of India Lord Linlithgow on Nov 14, 1939.",delhi: 'New Delhi' was inaugurated 91 years ago as India's grand capital - The Economic Times,2,2022

Initiating the debate on the budget in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the Congress leader said the government has not shared data on various important issues while evading job creation and welfare.

Countering the Prime Minister's allegation that Congress is a part of the tukde-tukde gang, Chidambaram said, Disruption is a way for change and innovation. There is disruption today in business, in science, technology, disruption in every activity. It creates the urge to bring about change. I am a member of the tukde, tukde gang which is the Hindi version of the word disruption.""

The Congress leader said he is not worried"" as the government does not have data to back these allegations.

We have no data on the tukde-tukde gang, no data on oxygen shortage deaths, on bodies flowing on rivers, on migrants, on doubling farmers income which should have been done by 2022. In other words, this is a 'No Data Available' government- i.e. NDA government,"" Chidambaram said.

Citing figures, the former FM said the prime minister should quote one data on jobs in his next speech. As on 31/3/21, there were 8,72,214 vacancies. The Almighty government recruited only 78,264 persons,"" he said, adding that this leaves nearly 8 Lakh youth unemployed.

He said inflation has risen in the country beyond the projected rate of the government, Disinvestment target of Rs 1,75,000 Crore was announced but the government has managed only Rs 78,000 Crore. He sought to know why the budget does not mention the plans of privatizing BPCL, CCI and Shipping Corporation of India, two national banks and an insurance company (LIC).

Chidambaram maintained that since the government is adept at making bad announcements, one should look at the outcome. He reiterated his stand that the budget should aim at three Ws- work, welfare and wealth creation.

Government had promised 60 lakh jobs in five years which comes to 12 Lakh per year. However, there are 47 Lakh job seekers every year. Urban unemployment rate is 7.9% while rural unemployment stands at 6.54%, according to CMIE data.

We are running fast to stay in the same place. This is not a treadmill,"" he said, sharing data on growth projection. He said 60 Lakh MSMEs have closed down, per capita income has declined and India stands at 101/116 countries in the Global Hunger Index.

Welfare has been thrown to the wind. This government has forgotten the poor which is mentioned only twice in the budget. Jobs is mentioned thrice. But the poor will not forget you,"" he said.

Arun Singh (BJP) rubbished these arguments and said the Narendra Modi government has worked for the poor and the weak in this inclusive"" budget which is aimed at those living in villages, the poor, the farmers, and the youth.

People have faith in the Modi government,"" he said. He listed the Digital India Mission, CBDC, repeal of archaic laws, ease of doing business, and the expected push to the MSME sector among the highlights of the budget.

Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda spoke on Karnataka being deprived of its share of river water and lack of drinking water in his state.

Earlier this week, a 14-member heritage panel gave its approval for construction of the new Parliament building under the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.

""The Central Public Works Department has asked Tata Projects Ltd to start the construction work of the new parliament building on Jan 15 as it is considered auspicious to commence such a project on the day of first dawn after 'Makar Sankranti',"" the official sources said.

The new building is being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor - envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister Residence and PMO, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

Sources said that Tata Projects started mobilising machinery and other items required to start construction work of the government's ambitious project.

The Heritage Conservation Committee on Monday gave its nod to the new Parliament project, after the Supreme Court asked the Centre to seek prior approval from the panel and other relevant authorities before starting construction work.

According to the plan, work on redevelopment of Rajpath will start soon after this year's Republic Day parade. The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath.

Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.

The new building will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.

The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.

According to the plan, provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker.","Centra Vista: Construction work of new Parliament building to start on Jan 15, say sources - The Economic Times",1,2021

Bose's choices were a m�lange  mythical figures  Krishna, Arjuna, Rama, Sita; sovereigns  Ashoka, Akbar, Tipu Sultan, Shivaji; freedom fighters  Rani Laxmibai, Gandhiji, Netaji all found place alongside motifs from Ajanta, Mahabalipuram and Harappa and India's natural endowments, its oceans and mountains. Yet Bose omitted representing the lives of ordinary Indians from his m�lange  no hardworking farmers, brave soldiers or unnamed revolutionaries made it.

His vision was at once awe-inspiring  marvelling at the hallowed past of this supposedly new nation, and top-down  looking at India from the lens of its nobility. This is not to fault Bose's choices. In fact, the new republic that came into existence in 1950 was in many ways a continuation of the old. Colonial ways of thinking about India as a space ruled by a succession of kings cannot overnight transform into a celebration of subaltern voices.

Similarly, symbols of colonial power do not, at the stroke of the midnight hour, become monuments of liberation. India's appropriation of the buildings of empire in the Central Vista as its seat of power  the Viceroy's House, Parliament House, North and South Blocks may have been pragmatic at the time. But architecturally, much like Bose's illustrations, they inspire awe and pride, rather than freedom and equality, which animated the struggle for Independence.

Today, seven decades on, if a democratically elected government wants to transform this edifice, that act is not an erasure of history. Instead, it is the recognition of a sentiment that has taken seven decades to mature  India is no longer to be defined by colonial symbols that we have made our own. Those symbols will stand as testament to a chequered past, a lived history to be neither demolished nor appropriated, but to simply remain.

But what is the animating vision of the transformed edifice that will reflect this changed sentiment? Bimal Patel, chief architect of the Central Vista revamp project, is a skilled professional. In each of his presentations, he has underlined that the revamp will supplement the existing ethos of the vista and not supplant it. It will be a site that will be a triumph of common sense"", through a functional, simple, robust and quiet design"".

These are certainly attributes that any building ought to possess. But the Central Vista is more than a set of buildings and spaces. It is the representation of India itself, translating the idea from its becoming to its being. So while Patel may want India to be commonsensical, functional and simple, others may want it to be aggressive, strategic and punch above its weight. Some others, while agreeing with Patel, may also want India to be non-hierarchical, fair and just. Translating these characteristics into design requires time, consultation and an open mind.

In this context, the Supreme Court judgment giving the legal go-ahead to the Central Vista revamp is a missed opportunity. Pressing the 'pause' button on the project, as Justice Khanna has done in his dissenting opinion, would have provided an opportunity for everyone to reflect more deeply on an enterprise that will define India for some time to come. It is also what the law, on balance, demanded.

The case in the Supreme Court was fundamentally a plea for 'democratic due process'  greater openness in formulation, selection and development of the final design. Pitched at this level, democratic due process is a principle of political prudence, not of judicial review. The judges were right to defer to the executive on this question instead of creating another doctrine devoid of clear meaning.

But deference cannot mean a free pass. It is clear from the case record that the prior approval and permission of the Heritage Conservation Committee, needed under the law for land use to be changed, was not taken. Holding that strict approval is not needed since some members of the committee also sat on another committee which had approved the project, is a strange proposition of law laid down by the majority judges.

Equally strange is their upholding of the environmental clearance given only to the renovation and expansion of the Parliament building. As the dissent rightly notes, slicing up of the entire project into parts and allowing piecemeal environmental clearance requires cogent reasons to be provided. Not providing such reasons, especially in a matter that will increase pollution levels in the most polluted capital city in the world, is unacceptable.

His order, asking the government to apply for environment clearance and change of land use again before proceeding, much like Patel's proposed design, is the triumph of common sense that the project needed. Even though it isn't the law, one hopes that the wisdom of the dissent is internalised.

One will not have to travel far from Parliament to reach other grand structures built speedily to change the seat of power. Less than 20 km away lies Tughlaqabad Fort, built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, moving his capital away from Lal Kot and Siri. Despite its grandeur, it remained the capital for only a few years and lies in ruins today. Currently it is best known for being a shooting range. Only with time, do things fall into place.

""The existing temple of democracy is completing 100 years... It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that the new one will be built by our own people as a prime example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat,"" Birla said here announcing details of the new proposed building.

""The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of independence, Parliament session will be held in the new building,"" he said.

Birla said the new building will be earthquake resistant and 2000 people will be directly involved in the construction of the new building and 9,000 indirectly.

He said as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan.

The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said.

He said the invitation will be extended to all political parties. While some would attend physically and others would attend virtually, Birla said, while adding that the ceremony would follow Covid-related guidelines.

A formal invitation to Modi was extended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday. As per rules, the speaker of the lower house of parliament is also the custodian of the parliament building.

Sufficient steps have been taken to control air and noise pollution during the construction work for the new parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs and those will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating 'paperless offices'.

The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.

In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members.

This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.

At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.

In Sep this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.

The iconic 16-feet high statue of Mahatama Gandhi is located opposite Gate Number 1 of Parliament House.

The statue greets visitors to Parliament House and has also been the location of gatherings, protests and press interactions by MPs.

According to Rajya Sabha's website, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditating posture sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by the then President of India Dr Shanker Dayal Sharma on Oct 2, 1993. It also said that the statue was donated by the Ministry of Urban Development.

In Sep, Tata Projects Limited had won the bid to construct a new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore.

The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi.

The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on Feb 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on Jan 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin.

CPWD has sought clearance for a `11,038 crore project for development of common central secretariat buildings and related buildings across 17,54,057 sqm. It told the ministry that the project would involve demolition of buildings in 3,95,839 sqm.

EAC asked CPWD about the demolition plan, mitigative measures, technique to avoid air pollution during demolition and assessment of the cumulative impact of development activities in the 10 sq km core area. It also sought details of tree cutting and overall benefits of the project. It sought that an assessment be carried out for traffic densities and parking capabilities in 5 km radius, besides a detailed traffic management and a traffic decongestion plan. Details of tree plantation, adequacy of power supply, waste water treatment, disposal of solid waste generated from the project besides pointwise replies to representation against the project"" too were sought.

The clearance is likely to be more of a formality as the plan has the Centre's backing. EAC has received representations that have warned that the Vista plan would impact the city's green lungs as massive tree cutting was likely. It has also been warned about pollution due to demolition, when the capital was in the throes of a severe air pollution crisis, and construction that would affect the heritage and character. The CPWD submission said the new buildings would improve productivity and efficiency through proximity and connectivity.

The green ministry's Expert Appraisal Committee has in Oct 21 meeting asked the CPWD to provide a 'Detailed demolition plan along with mitigative measures', look at ways for 'instant demolition of latest technique in place of extended demolition to avoid air pollution during demolition process' and carry out an assessment of the cumulative impact of all development activities proposed within 10 km area of the core.

Several of these questions have also been raised in the ongoing SC hearings on the project and why it is delinked with the near simultaneous effort to build a new Parliament. The Centre has firmly backed the plan in its arguments.

 These new offices shall have purpose designed and well-organised workspaces, with robust and secure communications infrastructure and reliable and environmentally conscious services infrastructure. It shall take care of environmental comfort, and shall include well designed break-out spaces, social amenities and well-managed support facilities"", the agency has said.

It has added that the Central Conference Centre is an integral part of the Central Secretariat facility for the Government of India. A large central facility that caters to the conferencing needs of all the ministries adds to the same intent, enhanced by the provision of internal people-mover shuttles within this area.

The first round of approvals, once a project reaches the EAC, is that of seeking Terms of Reference (TOR) necessary for projects seeking Environmental Clearance (EC) under the provisions of the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006.

With the TOR now issued for the Central vista redevelopment, the CPWD now has the go ahead to draw up the Environment Impact assessment and Environment management plan reports and submit it to the EAC for approval.

A top court bench, led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, again turned down a demand by the petitioners in the case for a stay on the project. There have been demands from green activists and heritage lovers for a stay on the project while its pros and cons may be properly debated.

The government was going ahead with it, advocate Sikhil Suri argued in court today. Another environment committee has granted yet another clearance to the project yesterday, he said, seeking a stay. The case can be heard on merits later but the government must assure the court that it will not press on with the project in the interim, he argued.

But Solicitor General Tushar Mehta refused to hold out any such assurance. Lordships may say whatever happens will be subject to orders of this court."" Justice Khanwilkar also wondered aloud if the court can restrain authorities from acting as per the law refusing a stay.

Instead the bench reiterated its earlier direction that anything done by the government will be subject to the final outcome of these proceedings. Whatever they do will be at their own risk,"" Justice Khanwilkar observed.

The bench also asked the petitioner, Delhi resident Rajeev Suri, to amend his plea and sought a detailed response from the central government on the issue while adjourning the case till Jul 17 for further hearing.

Two PILs, one by Lt Col Anuj Srivastava (retired), were filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the change in land use involved in the project which seeks to change Lutyens' Delhi, the heart of the capital, beyond recognition.

Col Srivastava's lawyer Sanjay Hegde also sought a stay today on the project insisting that the government may go on with the paperwork but not the groundwork.

The duo has opposed the project on the ground that it would adversely impact the environment, reducing green cover in the area to 9 per cent from the existing 86 per cent, and irretrievably change the heart of the city as we know it.

The project involves turning the existing Parliament building into a library and building a new one to house Parliament. A High Court single judge had initially stayed the project. A division bench led by the High Court Chief Justice later stayed the single judge order without hearing the parties.

The apex court made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

The top court was hearing a plea against the Delhi High Court order which said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project of the central government.

""Any change at the ground level will be at their own risk,"" said a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar.

The vehement plea of the petitioner that the ground situation at the site should not be changed as there are several monuments of national heritage which may be removed, did not cut much ice with the court which observed that the project will not be completed within a week.

The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, was informed by the petitioner that two notifications have been issued - one regarding land use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

""We have already said, whatever step are taken, it is on their risk,"" the bench observed.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on Jul 7, allowed the petitioner to amend his plea to challenge the recent decisions taken by the authority for the project.

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, argued that till the next date of hearing no clearance should be granted as all those clearances will also be challenged.

The bench asked the petitioner to file his compilation by Jun 23 and directed the Centre to file its response by Jul 3.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on Feb 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's Feb 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The two petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The revamp, which was announced in Sep last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

In the letter, also marked to Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, the former bureaucrats said there was no parliamentary debate or discussion that preceded the decisions taken with regard to the project.

Moreover, the redevelopment plans were not substantiated by any public consultation or expert review, it said.

The selection of the firm and the processes employed to do so leave a lot of questions unanswered, the letter added.

""In the post Covid 19 scenario, when enormous funds are required for strengthening the public health system, to provide sustenance to people and to rebuild the economy, taking up a proposal to redesign the entire Central Vista at a cost of at least Rs 20,000 crores, a figure likely to escalate significantly, seems particularly irresponsible.

""It seems like Nero fiddling while Rome burns,"" it said.

Signatories to the letter include retired IAS, IPS and IFS officers. Former DDA vice-chairman V S Ailawadi and former Prasar Bharti CEO Jawahar Sircar are also among them.

The Central Vista redevelopment project envisages constructing a new Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and revamping of the nearly 3.5-km-long stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate.

The letter said construction and redesign on the scale planned in the redevelopment project would significantly affect the heritage nature of this precinct and destroy it ""irrevocably"".

The former civil servants also pointed that the redevelopment planned will, moreover, cause severe environmental damage.

""This precinct is at the core of the congested capital of Delhi, and acts as the lungs of the city, with its dense mature tree canopies serving as a repository of bio diversity and the vast lawns of the Vista as a watershed for the city between the Ridge and the Yamuna,"" it said.

Constructing a large number of multi-storeyed office buildings, with basements, in this open area will create ""congestion and irreversibly change and damage the environment"".

""Delhi already suffers from enormous environmental pollution. To plan something which will increase this pollution many, many times, not merely during the construction phase but also subsequently, is clearly a thoughtless and irresponsible act,"" the letter further said.

The former bureaucrats also pointed out that the Central Vista serves at present as a recreational space for the whole city as families throng the area on summer nights to sit around in the open air and enjoy the occasional ice-cream - ""innocent and inexpensive pleasures"" which they will be deprived of once the vista's character undergoes a change.",Former bureaucrats raise concerns over Central Vista revamp project in letter to PM - The Economic Times,5,2020

Meanwhile, the Central Vista committee also approved the new plan- which has been strongly opposed by civil society organisations and opposition parties.

The green signal to the mega project in the national capital- given with the usual caveats on minimised tree cutting, environmental responsibility and so on- comes even as a Special Leave Petition related to land use change for the new complex is pending before the Supreme Court.

The SC also this week refused to stay the Central vista redevelopment project.

The expert panel of the environment ministry has said the clearance for the project to build a new Parliament is subject to the apex court's decision.

On an observation on the necessity of constructing a new Parliament building amidst the Current Health Emergency in the Country'', CPWD has responded saying that the existing Parliament Building was constructed 93 years ago and is in 'dire need of retrofitting'' and that development of a new building is of utmost importance'.

 Over the years many planned / unplanned changes have been made, often undocumented. It is in dire need of retrofitting as soon as possible. This can only be done once the Building is in vacant position and that will happen once the new Building is made available. Therefore, development of the proposed Parliament Building is of utmost importance"", the CPWD has said.

The department has further justified the increase in project cots form Rs 776 crore to Rs 922 crore citing changes in project specifications which have been approved after the application submission''.

The CPWD has said that it had indicated a tentative cost of Rs. 776 crores, based on initial concept plan prepared by Consultant and later had to add specific requirements of the end-users: in this case the Lok Sabha Secretariat, and Security Agencies etc.

After detailed deliberation with all stakeholders the Consultant modified the concept plan with built up area as 65,000 Sqm and accordingly tentative cost has been increased. The cost of Rs. 922 Crore has therefore been arrived based on revised built up area in consultation with user agencies"", the CPWD has argued in its submission from the EAC.

The department has further justified the delinking of the projects to build a new parliament building and the Central vista citing their different functions.

The proposed Parliament Building essentially carries out Legislative functions, which is separate from Executive Functions to be carried out in other office buildings and therefore cannot be considered as an integrated and inter-related project vis-�-vis the other proposed for the simple reason that it can definitely operate independently of the other structures"", it adds.

The redevelopment of the other Central Vista buildings is a distinct activity as opposed to the expansion and renovation of the Parliament"", the CPWD has said pointing also to their different scale and size among other aspects.

The department has also maintained that construction of the new complex will not lead to an air pollution beyond existing levels  and may see a potential decrease as state of the art and low or no emission vehicles get introduced over time.

Majority of the impacts of the combined structure are already occurring at the site. The expansion of the new Parliament Building will lead to environmental impacts, that are, if at all, minor and incremental, it says.

 The project proponents are aware of the heritage value of the Parliament Building. It is precisely because of the need to protect its heritage value, besides other practical aspects such as seating more members for the future and providing them with necessary infrastructure, that the project has been conceived. Once the Parliament expansion is carried out as proposed, the proposed project aims to undertake necessary structural and other activities required to sustain the existing Parliament Building for use by future generations of Indians"", it has been submitted.

With regards to cultural, landscape and other values, it has already been clarified that the proposed Parliament Building expansion will be necessarily reviewed and approved prior to construction by both the DUAC and the Central Vista Committee which have been specifically tasked and mandated with this work, the CPWD has sought to clarify.",Green nod to Rs 922 crore new Parliament complex - The Economic Times,5,2020

A bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice Aniruddha Bose, did not agree to the submission that the project in Lutyens' Delhi needed to be stayed as the government bodies were to approach the authorities concerned for clearance and other formalities.

""Nobody is going to do anything"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, said the bench.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said a new parliament building is being constructed and wondered as to why anybody should have objection to this.

""Shikhil Suri, counsel appearing for the petitioner prays for withdrawal of this petition with liberty to amend the writ petition...which has been transferred to this court from the High Court. Prayer is allowed. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty aforesaid,"" the apex court said in its order.

Another plea related to the project, filed by the same petitioner, is pending with the top court which refused to entertain the fresh plea.

The earlier plea was against the Delhi High Court order which had said that the DDA was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

Several new government buildings besides a new Parliament House are part of the project.

A division bench of the High Court on Feb 28 had stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the Delhi Development Authority to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The HC's stay order on the single judge bench's Feb 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The division bench of the High Court had also issued notice to the two individuals -- Rajeev Suri and Lt Col (retd) Anuj Srivastava -- on whose pleas the Feb 11 order was passed, and had listed the Centre and DDA's appeals for further hearing on May 6.

Suri and Srivastava, in their pleas before the single judge, have opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

They have contended that DDA does not have the power to bring about the proposed change in land use and master plan and only the central government can do so.

""It is an insensitive and inhumane decision of the government to cut DA of central employees, pensioners and jawans who are serving the public while fighting coronavirus, instead of suspending the bullet train project and the Central Vista beautification project of lakhs of crores (of rupees),"" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked the government to curtail 30 per cent of its own expenses and shelve the Central Vista redevelopment and bullet train projects to save money to be used to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

""The government of India, instead of helping people by giving them financial support in this crisis, is hurting them. Instead of curtailing its own wasteful expenditures, the government is cutting the money of the middle class people,"" he told an online press conference.

The government on Thursday froze inflation-linked allowance for its 1.1 crore employees and pensioners, a move states are likely to replicate, helping save a combined Rs 1.2 lakh crore that could be used to combat the coronavirus crisis.

Surjewala demanded that the government cut its own wasteful expenses by 30 per cent that could yield around Rs 2.5 lakh crore and take back its decision of freezing the dearness allowance and relief for employees, pensioners and defence personnel.

He also accused the government of ""misconceived"" priorities and policies and said on one side the prime minister is telling states and the private sector not to cut salaries of its employees and on the other, he is himself cutting the salaries of government employees.

""Is this not an indicator to the states and private sector...If this mayhem continues, how will you put money in the hands of people,"" he asked.

Surjewala said the government should shelve its Central Vista project of Rs 20,000 crore, of which the prime minister held a meeting even yesterday, as well as the Rs 1.10 lakh crore bullet train project and not cut the money of common people.

""Why are you attacking the incomes of the most vulnerable sections and instead not cutting your own waste expenditure,"" he asked.

The land use for seven plots measuring 90 acres in the heart of Delhi has been changed to accommodate a district park, office buildings for ministries and a new Parliament. The gazette notification follows a meticulous process under which Delhi Development Authority (DDA) called for objections on the land use change. A board of inquiry and hearing was constituted to address the objections. DDA admitted 1,292 objections and suggestions.

The plan would be to have the new Parliament on a 9.5 acre plot opposite the present Parliament. The Central Vista houses Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, North and South Block, India Gate and National Archives. All the iconic buildings were constructed before 1931, the year in which the new capital was inaugurated. The other office buildings were built on various plots subsequently to address the office requirements of central ministries in an unplanned manner. Parliament House building came up in 1927 and is declared heritage building.

The PIL cites a public notice issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Dec 21 to back its claim. The notice seeks to change the land use of almost 105 acre of the Central Vista. At least 90 acre of this is at present classified as public, semi-public district parks and neighbourhood play areas. Only 15 acre houses government offices.

However, the proposed change in land use will ensure that land for public use decreases from 86% to less than 9%. Over 80.5 acre of the stretch will be used for building government offices"". Such a change will deprive Delhi of the open spaces in Central Vista, which is steeped in history, the PIL said.

The ill-conceived land use changes without imprimatur will fundamentally alter the emotional connect of India and Indians with this 3.5-km living history and will be extremely detrimental to the area by increased population density, loss of green areas, public and semi-public spaces,"" the PIL said.


The noticeis arbitrary, capricious, whimsical and bad in law published unjustifiably without a Zonal Development Plan for Zone D as a corollary to Master Plan Delhi, 2021, and hence is unsustainable and deserved to be quashed,"" the PIL said.

The PIL was filed by Delhi resident Rajeev Suri in the Delhi High Court. Another was filed by Lt Col Anuj Srivastava. Acting on the PIL, Justice Rajiv Shakhder initially asked DDA on Feb 11, 2020, to inform the court before notifying the changes in the master plan to allow such land use. In case, a decision is taken to notify the proposed changes in the MPD (Master Plan Delhi) 2020-21, DDA will approach the court before notifying such decision,"" he had said.

That case was later recalled by the Delhi High Court and the order overturned by a division bench on Feb 28, 2020.

The petitioners then approached SC for relief, citing the fact that the CJ-led bench had issued the order ex parte without even hearing them.

He was responding to queries from reporters on Friday over two petitions filed by activists in the Delhi High Court and concerns raised by many other heritage and architecture experts on the proposed revamp.

""There has been total transparency in the project. Bimal Patel had held a meeting with editors and town planner earlier, and after that many others, and every other town planner in town. Then there was a meeting with journalists later,"" the minister said.

Puri said one of the concerns raised by a few people is that heritage buildings are going to be torn down.

""We have shown exactly that every iconic heritage building will be exactly where it is,"" the Union minister of Housing and Urban Affairs said.

Asked about other concerns raised by activists that the revamp project will ""take away a lot of public space"", Puri said, ""public space will in fact increase"".

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) is likely to be shifted from its current location as part of the Modi government's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- in Lutyens' Delhi, sources had earlier said.

It will be world-class infrastructure like Sydney Opera House and other such iconic buildings globally are, he said.

""So, for the Central Vista project, the amount of consultation we have done... Bimal Patel has met every conceivable town planner, architect. I have chaired meetings, the secretary has,"" he said.

It was purely a military ceremony in keeping with the fitness of things. It, perhaps, merits mention here that the Amar Jawan Jyoti was established to honour the fallen heroes who made the supreme sacrifice in the 1971 war. Now that we have a National War Memorial, it was appropriate to merge the two at one place.

Earlier, as Chief of Integrated Defence Staff, I had the privilege of steering the creation of the National War Memorial from design selection to construction. Until then, India Gate was the only memorial for soldiers at the national level.

This befitting National War Memorial was constructed at a very apt location--near India Gate. It is a simple yet elegant homage to the fallen military heroes. I recall that in the initial stages, there was a move from some quarters to locate this memorial in Delhi Cantonment.

One had to argue strongly against it, advancing the argument that it was a National War Memorial, not a military memorial. The average tourist and foreign visitor would not go out of the way to Delhi Cantt to see the memorial or to pay homage. India Gate complex was the best location to give it a high visibility at home and abroad.

It was only when the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) directed that it would be classified as a project of national importance and that it would come up at the present location, that we heaved a sigh of relief. The footfalls validate the thoughts behind the feeling regarding the location of the memorial.

Another interesting fact is that initially the Central Vista Committee had permitted its construction up to a height of 1.5 metres only. That would have been fairly unimpressive. So we decided to dig down, and that is the reason why we climb down the steps to reach the memorial. But we also got the officials concerned to visit the site after the construction has commenced and impressed upon them the need to erect a higher column to be a befitting tribute to the fallen heroes--those who had sacrificed their life for the country. Once they visited the site and saw for themselves the scale and importance of the project, they readily agreed to increase the height. The column now proudly stands 14 metres tall--an apt tribute to India's fallen bravehearts.

Earlier, all ceremonies to pay homage to India's bravehearts were at India Gate. India Gate is a war memorial constructed to pay homage to the fallen heroes of the First World War and Anglo Afghan War. Since the country did not have another war memorial at the national level, India Gate continued to serve as one. In 1972, the present Amar Jawan Jyoti was added to offer respect to those who sacrificed their lives for the country. This practice has continued ever since, by the leaders, public and foreign dignitaries.

In 2019, the present National War Memorial was dedicated to the nation by the prime minister. It is the official war memorial at the national level to pay homage to those who sacrifice their lives for the country, whether earlier or at present or in future. However, a base line of Indian Independence was taken to inscribe the names of the fallen heroes. It enshrines the names of all India's bravehearts who have made the supreme sacrifice since 1947.

Since then all ceremonial functions to pay homage on national days are held here. All foreign dignitaries also pay homage to the heroes here. So does the public. Besides the names of all fallen heroes since 1947, it aptly has several patriotic edifices, war murals and statues of the Param Veer Chakra awardees (the highest gallantry award) in keeping with the aura of a war memorial. The column also encapsulates the eternal flame that symbolises the immortality of the fallen heroes.

Today's ceremony was to merge the eternal flame of the Amar Jawan Jyoti with that of the National War Memorial. It is not being extinguished, only a part of the flame is being merged with that of the eternal flame at the National War Memorial.

Any needless controversy is a slight to the memory of India's bravehearts.

No heritage building will be demolished under the central project, Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri asserted.

While the main building of the National Archives will remain intact, its annexe will be demolished and a new building will be constructed, officials said.

The records at the National Archives, include 45 lakh files, 25,000 rare manuscripts, more than 1 lakh maps and 1.3 lakh Mughal documents.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor in Delhi - envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, a common Central Secretariat for ministries and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath - from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

In a press briefing, Puri said though plans are underway to shift the National Museum, the ""actual move is in the distant future"".

The 35,000-square metre museum will be shifted to the 1.67 lakh-square metre space in the North and South blocks, the officials said.

At present, the South Block houses the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs, while the North Block has offices of Home Ministry and Finance Ministry. Both the blocks are heritage buildings and are planned to be converted into museums as part of the Central Vista project.

However, neither Puri nor secretary at the culture ministry, Raghavendra Singh, who was also present for the briefing, said what the status of the building of the National Museum will be after the artefacts are shifted out.

""No heritage building will be demolished under the Central Vista project. The National Archive building is a heritage building and will remain as it is,"" Puri said.

""The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) will be shifted since we want a world class facility and there is no space in the current building for it. A new location has been decided. We want a world class facility comparable to the facilities in New York and Sydney. For, now, the artefacts will be shifted to the Janpath Hotel temporarily,"" the minister said.

The IGNCA has a huge collection of heritage pieces, manuscripts and an impressive collection of books at its library. The Janpath Hotel has been renovated to store these temporarily.

Culture Secretary Singh said that the National Museum is undergoing renovations and addition of galleries. Preparations are being done for shifting its contents to the bigger space, he said.

""The actual shifting of the museum will be in the distant future (baad ki baat) since first the 10 office buildings of the central vista will be constructed and then ministries will shifted. After that the museum interiors will have to be done,"" Union Minister Puri said.

Singh also said the Archaeological Society of India's old building near the museum has been renovated and now displays rare Buddhist artworks from its repository.

""We have made most of the opportunity given to us by the Covid pandemic where public entry was restricted and renovated the space inside the museum... We are also preparing to move to the North and South Block which has a 1.67 lakh square metre space as compared to the 35,000 sq metre space here,"" he said.

National Museum Additional Director General Subrat Nath said that the work on the expansion and renovation of the museum has been underway for more than two years.

Once open, he said, the museum will have additional galleries like the Kashi Gallery and another gallery on Central Asian Antiquities which will be digitised with the help of IIT-Bombay.

He also said that the rare 'Company paintings' of the 18th and 19th centuries will also now be showcased prominently.

Singh also said that technological interventions have also been made to make sure that the museum is ready to shift to its new locations.

The officials said that this includes cataloguing, 3D scanning, and inventorisation of the museum's collection.

The first phase of the National Museum building was formally inaugurated by Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the then vice president, on Dec 18, 1960.

The second phase of the building was completed in 1989.","National Archives a heritage building, won't be demolished; National Museum to be shifted - The Economic Times",5,2021

After awarding the contract for the construction of a new Parliament building, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has moved to the elaborate plan of constructing the Central Secretariat. According to sources, the government has given up its initial plan of first moving out offices to an alternate location, demolishing old buildings and then starting the construction of the new secretariat. The new plan is to begin construction on the largest plot of land and then shift offices from Bhawans to the newly- constructed structure.

Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) on Janpath Road, which is the largest plot of land, will be demolished at first. Then part of the Central Secretariat would be constructed. Sources said ministries housed in Shastri Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan would then be shifted to the newly-constructed offices. The two Bhawans would then be demolished. This would be the first part of the plan. The newly-constructed buildings would have enough space to accommodate the ministries that will be shifted. Earlier the plan was to shift offices to another location, demolish buildings and then begin construction. This would have caused major dislocation of government offices and even disruption of traffic,"" said a senior government official involved with the planning process.

CPWD, the nodal agency for implementation of the three-phase Central Vista redevelopment project, had earlier planned to shift offices in phases. However, after internal discussions, it was felt that this kind of office space would not be available anywhere in the national capital. At the same time, undertaking large-scale construction at the heart of Delhi would have meant traffic disruption and pollution. While Krishi Bhawan and Shastri Bhawan would be demolished, the neighbouring National Archives would be redeveloped but not demolished.

The new buildings are expected to be energy efficient with more space. Many ministries are now spread across 3-4 office buildings in numerous localities. A senior official told ET, Once the first building is constructed and offices of the two Bhawans are ready to be shifted, there would be more office spaces available in other places such as Bhikaji Cama Place and R K Puram as the ministries would be housed in one place. These would also shift to the heart of Delhi.""",Government draws up plan to begin the construction of Central Secretariat - The Economic Times,10,2020

It said that a new Parliament building, which will reflects indigenous technology, knowledge and expertise of India, was required to be built next to it.

The Constitution has frozen the number of seats in Parliament till 2026 but it may go up after the completion of the delimitation exercise, it said. A new building will be required to house a larger Parliament. The existing building cannot be expanded to build additional seating for a larger Parliament and will also be required to be vacated for 18 to 24 months for an overhaul, it said.

There is no plan to destroy any existing heritage structure. These will be upgraded to last longer, it said. There is also no plan to alter the central vista.


The CPWD affidavit also claimed that the government did not propose to spend `20,000 crore on the project at one go, but over six years. The affidavit claimed that to ensure smooth and unhindered functioning of Parliament, either an alternative building would have to be identified and suitably modified at considerable expense or a new building could be constructed.

Since the existing Parliament building cannot be expanded, it would be prudent to take up the construction of a new building, it said. The new Lok Sabha will be three times the existing one and the Rajya Sabha four times the existing size with the latest state-of-the art technology and will save Rs 1000 crore per year by way of rentals.

The proposal to build central secretariats in state capitals and prominent cities, mooted in Oct 2018, has got a fillip with the Centre's emphasis on kick-starting the economy with active work on infrastructure projects.

The Central Public Works Department has been entrusted with the job of construction of secretariats which would be developed as a high security office on the lines of Delhi's CGO Complex. It would have public dealing offices for central ministries and even accommodate ministries which have been looking for office space in states.

The government has received proposals from 17 state capitals: Gangtok (Sikkim), Patna (Bihar), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Chandigarh (Punjab/ Haryana), Jammu (J&K), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Guwahati (Assam), Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh), Kohima (Nagaland ), Shillong (Meghalaya), Aizawl (Mizoram), Agartala (Tripura), Puducherry, Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Panaji (Goa) and Leh (Ladakh).

The offices will need 140 acres in 17 cities. CPWD had held a meeting with states through videoconferencing last week to push the proposal, even as opposition parties have been demanding that the Centre scrap expensive projects like redevelopment of the Central Vista in New Delhi and construction of a new parliament building.

According to sources, the states have given their proposals and required land. The largest central secretariats are expected to be in Bhubaneswar and Jaipur.

An official in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the nodal agency for the ambitious project of the Modi government, said people would have access to the North and South Blocks once they are turned into museums.

At present, the South Block houses the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs, while the North Block has offices of Home Ministry and Finance Ministry.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista - the nation's power corridor in Delhi - envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, a common Central Secretariat for ministries and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath - from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

""According to the current plan, South Block will reflect the country's history till 1857 while North Block will show the history after 1857.

While announcing the name of the selected urban design firm, Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the facade of North and South Blocks wouldn't be touched and the existing Parliament House wouldn't be demolished.

Sources said there is enough space to build a new structure behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, which faces the present Parliament building. Currently, this space is used for parking. They added that while the existing parliament has huge open space, the new one could have more built-up area to accommodate the possibility of more MPs after fresh delimitation.

Urban affairs ministry officials said the conceptual plan of HCP was selected considering that the entire proposal was not flashy and was close to the government's requirement. They added that the current height restrictions in the Lutyens' area at 26 to 32 meters would be maintained while sealing the redevelopment plan. Some of the buildings may be razed and even a new Central Conference Centre may come up. Currently, Vigyan Bhawan is used for conferences.

Addressing the event here on the theme of 'Emerging trends in public architecture', Puri said a reputed architect recently wrote to him, alleging that the government is going to ""destroy"" the Parliament building.

""Who said we will destroy Parliament?"" the minister asked and explained the government has reached a stage of just inviting ideas from architecture firms for the ambitious project.

They say the correct way is to first have a proper heritage assessment plan of the historic area and then invite architecture firms to plan the redevelopment.

The government's move to redevelop Central Vista and Parliament and develop a new Common Central Secretariat to house ministries has raised the hackles of conservationists. Heritage experts say that though there is a need to redevelop the area and there is nothing objectionable"" about the government's plan, there is a need to tread carefully.


Conservationist AGK Menon said, Nobody can deny that there is a need to redevelop. I am a conservationist but we cannot freeze heritage. But at the same time the government needs to tread carefully. Before we start conservation there's need to do an assessment about what needs to be done in these sensitive areas. After all we need to decide the parameters.""

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has floated a request for proposal inviting national and international architecture firms for development or redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista (a 3-km stretch extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan, North and South Blocks till India Gate)"". Menon said: This is not a simple conservation exercise. It is complicated. When INTACH undertook projects inside Rashtrapati Bhawan and when Delhi sent its nomination for World Heritage City, a heritage impact assessment was done. It was then discussed with Central Vista Committee and Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) before we even started on these projects.""

Heritage conservationist KT Ravindran also stressed on the need for a vision document, discussed and passed by experts in DUAC and Central Vista Committee. It is not a parcel of land in Gurgaon.

Under its mega plan to redevelop the over three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi, the Modi government has floated a request for proposal for the ""development or redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista.""

Asked about the site and design of the Parliament Building, Puri said these aspects are currently ""under consideration"".

""As of now, the timeline is expected that by mid-Oct we should be able to float tender (for the design) and by next year the construction may begin"".

Earlier in his address, he spoke about the Prime Minister's ambitious project of redeveloping the prime government complex spread from Raisina Hill to India Gate, including North Block and South Block and Parliament complex.

""The North Block and South Block and the 3.5-km Central Vista spreading from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, all of that will be redeveloped,"" he said.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), under the ministry which maintains the area around India Gate, Boat Club and Central Vista, would implement the `45-crore project.

The biggest draw of the project would be installation of colourful musical fountains in two water channels near India Gate. Another colourful fountain would be installed near the canopy at India Gate, a 73-foot cupola constructed in 1936 as a tribute to Emperor of India, King George V, on his death. According to sources, the three fountains would be musical and short shows would be planned in the evening to regale the visitors.

Beyond India Gate, colourful static fountains would be installed in 12 water channels in Central Vista area. A senior official told ET, The musical fountains would be installed at India Gate. At Central Vista, the fountains are planned as colourful static fountains.""

At present, there are four major functional fountains at Vijay Chowk, the large piazza at the base of Raisina Hills leading up to North and South Blocks and Rashtrapati Bhavan. With Parliament in the background, the fountains add to the charm of Central Vista.

The project is expected to increase footfalls at India Gate and Central Vista lawns, which are popular destinations for tourists. The work is expected to start in Apr. The last redevelopment of the area was planned in the run-up to Commonwealth Games in 2010.

The Rs 20,000-crore project, which will completely overhaul the power corridor in Delhi, involves the construction of a new Parliament, new residences for the prime minister and vice-president and 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, as part of the Central Secretariat Project.

For this purpose, several historical buildings in the area will be torn down to make way for the offices. A total area of 4,58,820 square metres will be demolished for the project.

The new Parliament building, which is being constructed in the same premises as the old one, is expected to be ready by 2022.

Meanwhile, the first three buildings of the Central Secretariat Project are expected to be completed by 2023. These buildings will replace the India Gandhi National Centre for Arts (INGCA), a historic building of the national capital that houses several heritage pieces, manuscripts and also a massive library. It will now be shifted opposite Hyderabad House.

Buildings to be razed for Central Vista

However, INGCA is not the only building to be demolished for the project. Eleven other buildings will be razed to make way for the Modi government's ambitious redevelopment project.

This includes the Vice President's house, which is near the National Museum at present, and will be shifted to north of the North Block. The Prime Minister's Office and residence, conversely, will be built near the South Block. All the old structures will be dismantled.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan, which houses the Ministry of External Affairs currently, will make way for a seven-storey building. Furthermore, buildings such as Krishi Bhawan and Shastri Bhawan will be demolished and shifted to the new secretariat. A new conference hall, which is also part of the Central Vista project, will be constructed in place of the Vigyan Bhawan.

ThePrint takes a look at all the buildings that will be demolished for the Central Vista project:

Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts: The IGNCA was launched on 19 Nov 1985 by Rajiv Gandhi in memory of the late prime minister, and his mother, Indira Gandhi as a resource centre to study the arts. This included literature, visual arts, architecture, photography, music, dance and much more. The IGNCA is situated on Janpath, opposite the National Archives building. It comes under the Ministry of Culture.

Shastri Bhawan: Named after former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Shastri Bhawan houses several government ministries such as human resource development, chemicals and petrochemicals, law and justice, information and broadcasting, corporate affairs, women and child development and many others.

Krishi Bhawan: Situated on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg in Rajpath, several government ministries operate out of the Krishi Bhawan. This includes the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Animal Husbandry and Ministry of Fisheries.

Vigyan Bhawan: The government's primary convention centre, Vigyan Bhawan was built in 1956. It has hosted multiple national and international conferences, such as Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1983, the seventh Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in 1983 and the SAARC Summit. The annual National Film Awards also take place in the Vigyan Bhawan, which is maintained by the Central Public Works Department.

Vice President's Residence: The Vice President's Residence, home to current VP M. Venkaiah Naidu, is situated on 6, Maulana Azad Road. With a sprawling lawn in the front, the residence covers 6.48 acres and shares a boundary wall with Vigyan Bhawan.

National Museum: On 15 Aug 1949, the National Museum was inaugurated in Rashtrapati Bhawan by C. Rajagopalachari, the first Governor-General of India. It was later moved and the foundation stone of the present building on Janpath Road was laid by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in May 1955. At present, the museum holds almost 2,00,000 objects that are diverse in nature "" both Indian as well as foreign "" including the famous dancing girl of Harappa, relics of Buddha, Tanjore paintings and many more.

The museum is home to historical artefacts dating back 5,000 years. It is currently under the administrative control of the culture ministry.

Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan: The newest building among the lot, barely a decade old, the Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan is where the Ministry of External Affairs is based out of. Built over 60,000 square meters and at a cost of Rs 220 crore, it was the first government building to get a 'green building certification'.

Nirman Bhawan: Situated on the Rajpath Area of the Central Secretariat, Nirman Bhawan also houses government ministries such as housing and urban affairs, health and family welfare, and Department of Science and Technology.

Udyog Bhawan: Udyog Bhawan falls on the Yellow Line of the Delhi Metro and is adjacent to Janpath. It is where government ministries such as the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the MSME (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) Ministry, operate out of.

Raksha Bhawan: Situated on Man Singh Marg, Raksha Bhawan is the official residential complex of the National Defence College.

Annexe building of National Archives: Although the main building of the National Archives will be intact, the annexe building will be demolished and a new building will be constructed. The archival records are kept in both the main building and the annexe. The nature of records are categorised as public records, private papers, departmental records, cartographic records etc. The archival records kept in the annexe include 45 lakh files, 25,000 rare manuscripts, more than 1 lakh maps and 1.3 lakh Mughal documents.

The records are kept in an ideal storage environment and round the clock operation of air-conditioning is provided to maintain the relative humidity and temperature that is suitable for the records.

Lok Kalyan Marg (7 Race Course Road): Lok Kalyan Marg or '7 RCR', as it is commonly called, is the Prime Minister's residence currently. Former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi made it his home in 1984 but it was only, 16 years later, in 1990 that the urban development ministry declared it as the permanent residence-cum-office of the Prime Minister of India.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta also defended the redevelopment of the Parliament building, saying the 100-year-old structure was showing signs of distress and faced safety issues, something that has been voiced by its members and speakers too.

Since the members had indicated inadequacies with the present structure, Mehta added, there was no need for a separate independent study to decide if a new Parliament was required, as has been demanded by those challenging the project.

The solicitor general made his submission before a bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, in response to allegations that there was illegal change in land use for the project.

The top court was hearing two petitions challenging the redevelopment project that involves construction of a new Parliament House and 10 administrative buildings for all government ministries. It also includes converting the existing North and South blocks into museums. The project also proposes development of the Central Vista that connects Rajpath to the India Gate.

While issuing notices on the petition, the top court had refused to stay the project, but made it clear that its validity will be subject to the outcome of the petitions before it.

'Heritage buildings will be conserved, not demolished'

According to the government, there is a shortfall of about 0.38 million square meters in office space. With the Central Vista project, this space crunch shall be taken care of since the plan envisages a common secretariat for 51 ministries.

The Parliament project, Mehta said, faces fire safety and space issues, and is showing signs of distress, necessitating the construction of a modern building.

Mehta also assured the bench that existing heritage buildings shall not be demolished but conserved. The present Parliament will be there as it is. The ceremonies will be held in the central hall. Other rooms will be converted into MP chambers and offices for staff,"" he told the bench.

On the construction of a new Parliament building, he said, it has to be at Central Vista and cannot be built in Gurgaon (Gurugram), Panipat or Noida"".

In response to the petitioners' claim that no expert advice was sought for this project, Mehta said, If I feel that the house I am living in is not enough, I do not need to invite an expert to determine that.""

He also said that both Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha remain packed when joint sessions are held, forcing members to sit on plastic chairs. Mehta highlighted security concerns too, pointing at the 2001 Parliament attack. The building is also not earthquake-proof, he added.

'Government welcomes SC scrutiny, but there should be leeway'

Mehta also countered arguments that no design competition"" was held before finalising the plan. He informed that there was a concept competition"", since the buildings proposed are functional and not ornamental.

A design competition is held for projects like war memorials, India Gate etc. that are monuments and do not serve functional purpose,"" he said. The solicitor general added that he would make elaborate arguments on this issue later.

Mehta welcomed the Supreme Court's scrutiny of the project but said considering the history of the place where the redevelopment is happening"" the government should be allowed some leeway.

Whether there should be a new Parliament or not is a policy decision, which the government is empowered to take. Unless it is utterly arbitrary and atrocious, it is something which the government can decide,"" he told the bench.

He also dismissed the petitioners' argument that there was non-application of mind"" while procuring statutory approvals. Mehta will continue with his arguments Wednesday (4 Nov) as the hearing remained inconclusive Tuesday.

My critique of architect Bimal Patel's impressive Rs 13,450 crore makeover project is that it doesn't have a plan to acknowledge, retrieve and repair this loss. It just doesn't have a 'historicising' element.

All changes bring along tremendous anxieties, especially those that are disruptive and transformative like the 86-acre Central Vista redevelopment plan. These anxieties about losing the past must be addressed. It will go a long way in turning this contested initiative into a truly public one. Right now, the new Central Vista project has a history-shaped hole in its scope.

The Supreme Court will hear ten petitions opposing the Central Vista project, but nobody actually believes it will be struck down. With the bhoomi pujan at India Gate done, Modi should now focus on the role of the public and on preserving public history. The people's history that resides in historic buildings just can't be shifted to new glossy structures.

Raise public stake in the Central Vista

Almost every rebuilding and revitalising project in countries like the United States or the United Kingdom is accompanied by a call to people to donate personal artefacts and oral histories  a kind of public history drive that harvests people's memories of the space.

Modi's new Central Vista project will go a long way in assuaging public criticism if it can enlist people to deposit their memories around the buildings that will be torn down, and assure them they will be preserved in the public archives, universities and displayed in museums. It can add an element of public participation to the mammoth project. It will be an acknowledgement that there was a lived past in these buildings before the bulldozers arrived.

This usually increases people's stake in new projects and diminishes, over time, their sense of loss. Ctrl-alt-del is what empires do; it's not suitable for a democracy.

National Museum history

Apart from the many ministries, the iconic National Museum will also be taken down and shifted to the South and North Blocks. An office building will come up in its place.

The National Museum building (designed by the architect Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar who was also the first head of the Central Public Works Department) has a rich history. It was established after Independence to celebrate the ancient culture of the young state"" and its mandate was to show that India was eternal"" and great"", wrote art historian Kavita Singh.

Soon after Independence, the Royal Academy in London held an exhibition titled 'The Arts of India and Pakistan'. When they sent the artefacts back to India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan used them to set up a temporary exhibition. It was very well-attended, and this germinated the idea for an overarching Delhi-based museum. One of Jawaharlal Nehru's ministers wrote to the owners of these artefacts across India requesting them to let the objects stay in Delhi.

Today, a significant portion of the National Museum's collection remains locked in storage. Shifting to two larger buildings in the South Block and North Block will create an opportunity for many of these artefacts to see light, to be displayed and viewed by the public.

But when the National Museum is torn down, we must pay attention to not just the artefacts, but also its public memory. The historical details of Deolalikar's work (who also designed the Supreme Court building), of Nehru laying the foundation stone and S. Radhakrishnan inaugurating it, the names of the invitees, the speeches, the first few visitors, their photographs and family memories; the details of how the building changed, how the museum runs a post-graduate degree course in museology, diplomas in art history and art appreciation and conservation (Congress leader Sonia Gandhi attended one course). Deolalikar's family must be contacted for oral histories and memorabilia that they are bound to have.

Ministries and memories

The only research into the past that Bimal Patel's large team has done or planned for is to study the old architectural designs, conduct audit of the materials used and document the haphazard changes made to the structures in recent decades. They are doing a detailed photographic and video documentation of buildings. This research is valuable from purely an architectural point of view "" to build new structures and to renovate old ones. But they don't help in the narrative history project.

So far, there has been no effort to track down families of the old CPWD architects and designers of the ministry bhawans. Of course, some of them would be dead, but their families would be alive and may have some memories, letters, diaries, mementos. The first generation of government employees who worked in these buildings are a catchment constituency for any oral history project.

When IIC turned 50

Here's an example of what public histories of old buildings can offer. When the India International Centre (IIC) turned 50, I was part of a team of oral historians that Srishti School of Design scholar Indira Chowdhury led. I conducted oral history sessions with early members of the IIC  to understand and preserve the intangible heritage of the building. These included capturing what the first few decades of the IIC looked like, the sense of pride in the unique Stein architecture, the landscape, its emergence as an important meeting place for intellectuals, and the meaning of Nehru's 'internationalism' that is embedded in this institution.

Early members reminisced about the IIC elections, conversations in the lounge, VIP guests, who looked after the cultural events, gardens and the library. The IIC made this effort to dig into the history while older members are still alive. At least two of the half a dozen people I spoke to  Kuldeep Nayyar and B.G. Verghese  have since died. Oral history and artefact collection projects are always a race against time.

History of the Now

The problem is that Indians don't regard contemporary history as history worth capturing. Many of the government buildings have existed in the heart of the nation's capital for more than half a century and are worth historicising.

When we think of history, we think of ancient, medieval and colonial history. Similarly, our understanding of the museum institution is all about collecting archaeological and royal artefacts. Can CPWD engineers and architects and ordinary government employees in ministries and the Parliament building be considered history creators? It is time we upend our limited understanding of history, of what is worth preserving "" and include contemporary public histories. We have to be mindful of what the next generation of scholars or the next century would be studying about our shared present. Oral histories are archived universities in developed Western nations and are considered precious primary sources for students' papers. In the US, oral histories of the railroad project, civil rights movement and disability rights (I worked on the last one) are some publicly accessible examples.

This is why we need to be creating museums today like a grand IT history in Bengaluru, a museum of Indian democracy, or of Indian media history or economic history. The present Parliament Museum is good but it is mainly an institutional and political history. It does not include the memories and artefacts of people who work or have worked there.

Time is running out

Of course, there are valid questions about whether such a monumental project should be a priority for the Modi government, given the constraints on budget in the current economy, the ongoing pandemic, the need to spend scarce money on real infrastructure of highways and ports, and that familiar logic of 'don't fix what ain't broken'.

But that is precisely what Bimal Patel and his team are trying to tell us. That the old city centre is broken. That the buildings in the prime real estate of the country's capital suffers from gross inefficiency in its usage pattern. Most of this valuable land has been turned into a sea of parking. The ministry buildings are spread across the city. Only 22 ministries out of 51 are located within the Central Vista area. And the Parliament building is old, unsafe and cramped.

But the ten petitions in the Supreme Court are about issues like transparency, consultation, permissions and land use. Many have criticised the project as an example of the emperor's megalomania, Modi's monumental ego and even called it a palace built on the ruins of a liberal democracy.

But none of them raise the issue of conserving tangible and intangible histories that we will lose forever. This needs urgent focus. Time is running out.

Bimal Patel likes to say that the new Central Vista's goal is to extend the vista and expand the public space"". Let's bring the public into the project.

On 26 Jan 2022, visitors coming to Rajpath to watch the programme will not only have better seating arrangements with better views but also access to improved civic amenities, including pedestrian-friendly underpasses to manage the footfall efficiently, defined parking spaces, signages, drinking water facility and toilets.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the primary construction wing of the central government, that is working on the project plans to put up mechanised bleachers, with the capacity to seat 4,000 people, which are easy to install and dismantle.

The refurbished Central Vista Avenue will ensure that arrangements for the Republic Day events are planned better and are less disruptive. They will cause less damage to the Central Avenue landscape annually,"" said a senior official of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry.

The need to revamp the Avenue was necessitated because over the years the existing infrastructure had undergone massive wear and tear thanks to heavy use.

The Rs 477-crore Central Vista Avenue is part of the Central Vista Revamp Project aimed at giving Delhi's power corridor a complete makeover. Coming up as part of the redevelopment project are a new triangular-shaped Parliament, a new PM's residence, and 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, including Shastri Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, and Vayu Bhavan. These buildings currently house the offices of central ministries such as education, health, housing, agriculture, commerce, air force, among others.

Housing ministry officials involved with the Central Vista Avenue project told ThePrint that despite heavy unexpected rains last month that slowed down work, they are confident that the project will be ready in time to host the Republic Day parade next year.

Work was affected by the unexpected rains in Sep. But it's picked pace again,"" a second ministry official, who did not want to be named, said.

The new-look Central Vista Avenue

Once complete, the official added, the green cover on Rajpath is set to increase "" the lawn area will increase from 3.5 lakh square metres to 3.9 lakh sq metres. Approximately 12 low-level bridges will come up over the water canals.

The Central Vista Avenue will also have dedicated vending spaces.

The vendors are now located in a haphazard way, which inconveniences the public visiting the Rajpath area and causes traffic bottlenecks. Dedicated vending space will help in decongesting the area,"" the second official said.

The official said that while refurbishing the existing infrastructure, care has been taken to ensure that the area and its surroundings retain their essential character. For instance, the original tree-lined landscape will not be changed in any way. Trees will continue to be there on both sides of the Rajpath and original species, including jamun and Maulsari among others, will continue to dot Rajpath.

A walkway and a cycling path linking India Gate to the Yamuna are also on the cards.

There will be a bus shuttle available on the route. The Housing ministry is also planning a National Biodiversity Arboretum in a 75-acre land behind the Rashtrapati Bhawan, which will have collections of plants from different climatic zones of India.

The Central Vista Redevelopment Project is being implemented in a phased manner by the CPWD. Gujarat-based architect Bimal Patel's firm HCP Designs had won the bid in Oct 2019 to design the project.

Shoddy decision-making spurred by personal ambitions that don't concern or benefit the larger masses of the country is a tale in ignominy. When you add the precarious context of the Covid-19 pandemic to the mix, a wiser and deeper introspection becomes a necessity. The Narendra Modi government's investment in the Central Vista project with an estimated cost of Rs 20,000 crore raises more questions than it answers.

The situation in India at present is nothing short of dire. More than a 100 people have lost their lives in hospitals due to lack of oxygen and thousands have been denied admissions due to either lack of oxygen or beds.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health had warned the government of acute shortage of oxygen as far back as in Oct 2020. And even before that, in Apr, just a week into the nationwide lockdown, one of the government's own empowered groups of officers had red-flagged the shortage of oxygen.

The ludicrous line of reasoning resorted to by the government last year was that the contraction of the Indian economy, in the wake of the pandemic, was an Act of God"". Fourteen months since, we can't still be passing the blame.

There are three ways of evaluating the propriety of the Modi government's actions: First is the moral ground of the allocation of funds and other resources towards the Central Vista project. Second, the misplaced priorities. And third, the question of timing.

Choosing Central Vista over people's lives

It's appalling to see that 14 months have passed since the Covid pandemic first broke out, seven months since the experts warned of an acute oxygen shortage and of a second wave, and three months since the Budget 2021 allocations were presented to us. While all this was going on, the contract for Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project was awarded in Sep 2020 and the construction began in Jan 2021. Add to it all, the project has been provided an 'Essential Services' tag during the second wave.

Compare this to the allocations made in Budget 2021 to fight the pandemic. The 137 per cent increase in allocations towards health was also a sham. If one breaks it down, it comes down to a PR stunt yet again. The only allocation to fight the Covid pandemic has been Rs 35,000 crore that was assigned for the vaccination drive, but just one month into the financial year 2021, the government has put the onus on states and households for vaccination. It would have been heartening if the Budget contained allocations for ventilators, oxygen containers, concentrators and everything that could help us raise an honest and brave fight against this deadly virus, especially when a third Covid wave is now expected towards the end of this year.

How many new hospitals were constructed since the pandemic broke? None. When it costs close to Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 crore to set up an AIIMS, could a few new super-specialty hospitals not have been built in the last 14+ months? While the sprawling Central Vista campus is expected to be ready in two years, AIIMS Madurai is still a work in progress "" six long years after the official announcement. This clearly indicates misplaced priorities. Even economically, when India is headed towards another lockdown and the question of 'lives vs livelihood' is staring at us again, could the Central Vista fund not have been used for a scheme benefitting the unemployed or for low-income groups?

Waking up when the house was on fire

Now let's analyse the issue from the perspective of time. This crisis did provide us with a seven-month window to buckle up. And when did we finally wake up from our slumber? The Modi government approved Rs 4,500 crore to the two Indian vaccine manufacturers "" Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech "" only on 19 Apr 2021. This will only help scale manufacturing capacity after three-four months. After 100 days of vaccination, the government has not been able to fully vaccinate even 2 per cent of the population. Procuring more vaccines from global manufacturers to expedite the vaccination drive should have been the focus. The government approved setting up 551 PSA medical oxygen plants only on 25 Apr and announced orders for close to 61,000 ventilators on 1 May. It's a matter of shame that only when the house was under fire that the Modi government could think of scouting for ways to douse it.

History is always kind to those who strive to get their names etched in the hearts of people rather than in brick and mortar. We are a nation of limited resources, but with immense potential. Being wise and prudent in decision-making is perhaps most valued in a nation like ours. We have done grave injustice to the lakhs of people affected by this deadly virus who wander from hospital to hospital in the hope of getting some help. We, as citizens, wish for an India at 75 that is prepared to make all efforts to value lives a lot more and invest heartily towards the happiness and health quotient of its citizens, rather than moving our parliamentarians to a lavish complex.

556,https://theprint.in/india/after-3-missed-deadlines-central-vista-avenue-finally-ready-awaiting-inauguration/1089611/,"New Delhi: After missing several deadlines, the revamp of the 3 km-long Central Vista Avenue, one of the national capital's largest public spaces that stretches from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, is finally complete, officials in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) told ThePrint.

Earlier supposed to be completed by Dec 2021, the project saw delays, which led to it missing two more deadlines "" May and Jul 2022.

The Central Vista Avenue, which includes Rajpath, has been closed to the public since Feb 2021. A senior ministry official, who did not want to be named, confirmed to ThePrint that redevelopment work on the Avenue is over and it will be opened shortly, but the inauguration date is yet to be finalised.

The revamped Rs 477 crore Central Vista Avenue is part of the Central Vista redevelopment project aimed at giving Delhi's power corridor a complete makeover. The need to refurbish the Avenue arose due to the existing structure having undergone massive wear and tear over the years due to heavy use.

The Avenue, among other things, will have a 1.5 km granite pavement on both sides, 99 acres of expansive lawns, 16 food stalls, an amphitheatre for open air performances, low-level bridges over refurbished canals, and improved public amenities.

The senior ministry official further said that care has been taken to ensure that the area and its surrounding retains its essential character"" while refurbishing the existing infrastructure. For instance, the original tree-lined landscape of Rajpath will not be tinkered with in any way.

What the public can expect

The green cover on Rajpath is set to increase "" the lawn space will increase from 3.5 lakh square metres to 3.9 lakh square metres "" and there will be 12 low-level bridges over the water canals. There will also be a tree avenue and the space will be disability-friendly.

Four underpasses will connect the entire stretch, making it a seamless walkable avenue, and the parking spaces developed will accommodate approximately 1,000 cars at a time.

Visitors and tourists will also have access to the dedicated vending spaces, which will include 16 food stalls. Until now, vendors were positioned in a haphazard way on Rajpath, which would cause much inconvenience to the public visiting the area and often lead to massive traffic bottlenecks.

The overall Central Vista revamp project is being implemented in a phased manner by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). Gujarat-based architect Bimal Patel's firm HCP Designs had won the bid in Oct 2019 to design the project.

The other structures coming up as part of the redevelopment project are a new triangle-shaped Parliament, a new residence for the prime minister, and 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, including Shastri Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan and Vayu Bhawan.

These buildings currently house the offices of different central ministries such as education, health, housing, agriculture, commerce, as well as of the Indian Air Force.

A walkway and a cycling path linking India Gate to the Yamuna river is also on the cards.

A shuttle bus will ply on this route. The MoHUA is also planning a National Biodiversity Arboretum spread over 75 acres behind the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which will house collections of plants from different climatic zones of India.

This is Rs 767.56 crore more than Rs 1,833.43 crore given in the last fiscal. The redevelopment project of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-kilometre Rajpath boulevard that stretches from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and a new Prime Minister's Office as well as a new Vice President's Enclave.

A sum of Rs 2,600.99 has been been allocated for the construction of non-residential office buildings, including the Parliament and Supreme Court of India. For residential purposes, the ministry has been given Rs 873.02 crore.

Six infrastructure firms, including Tata Projects Limited, L&T Limited and Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited, are in the race to win the contract to construct the Executive Enclave, which will house the new PMO, Cabinet Secretariat, India House and National Security Council Secretariat.

According to the proposed plan, the Executive Enclave will come up on the south side of the South Block in plot number 36/38 in the high-security zone in Lutyens' Delhi.

Last year, Larsen & Toubro Limited had been awarded the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat.

Tata Projects Limited is constructing a new parliament building while Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue stretching from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

Suspending the project also offers the opportunity to re-evaluate the proposal from an architectural and urban design perspective, because it was justified largely on those grounds.

The project has never been subjected to thorough public scrutiny. In fact, it veils insidious political agendas, dangerous environmental and procedural compromises, and an unconscionable usurping of public spaces for government use. Not least, it is the banal, militaristic architecture and urban design that mutilates a potential UNESCO World Heritage Site listing. It is an urban harakiri.

The Modi government is, however, obdurate and proceeding with manic speed on this suicidal mission. All objections will be addressed, it says.

Where are the studies?

Today, seven months into the project, the cynical nature of the Modi government's assurances is apparent. In juridical terms, the government has substituted 'rule of law' with 'rule by law'. A complicit bureaucracy and a compliant judiciary enable the project proponent to alter the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 to suit the proposed revamp.

Development control norms are being enhanced by permitting the use of Transport Oriented Development (TOD) incentives that are normally offered to increase ridership along Metro routes serving dense urban corridors. The result is that the quantum of construction proposed for the Central Vista project far exceeds the sustainable holding capacity of this Master Plan designated heritage precinct. All this, we are assured, is being done legally.

There are other egregious faults. Prudent administrative and fiscal practices dictate that large architectural and urban projects of this scale and scope should be backed by exhaustive management studies, heritage and environmental impact assessment studies, traffic and transport evaluations, detailed project reports and, of course, wide public consultation. There is no evidence that these prerequisites have been followed. Instead, what is evident is that the project is following a plan-as-you-go roadmap.

Also read: Narendra Modi wants to rebuild New Delhi for no good reason

Against Delhi Master Plan objective

In architectural and urban design terms, it relies on self-serving assumptions without examining alternative options. It assumes, for example, that a new parliament building is required to cater to an expected increase in the number of parliamentarians, implicitly jettisoning the historical, cultural and psychological value of continuing to use the existing building as a potent symbol of Indian democracy.

In the United Kingdom, for example, with a roughly similar situation, its historic Parliament building is being carefully upgraded to accommodate the House of Commons, while a new House of Lords will be built in York as a political gesture to promote regional inclusivity.

Ad hoc perceptions appear to rationalise the construction of ten square doughnut-shaped, multi-storeyed buildings to accommodate all government offices, assuming that the consolidation of government offices in a centralised location will make for efficient functioning. Where are the management studies to justify this contrarian logic? It flies against the current worldwide trend to downscale government offices, decentralise and rely on digital technologies to promote efficient and effective delivery of government services. More importantly, it goes against the cardinal objective of the Delhi Master Plan 2021 to decentralise government offices.

Also read: Delhi power corridor makeover will cost Rs 20,000 crore, but there are no funds for it yet

Does cost justify benefit?

An important principle of prudent project management is the practice of frugality. Independent India has often practised this to a fault. Fiscal control and audit systems are deeply embedded in our governance psyche, yet this major project of the Modi government abandons their imperatives.

The purpose-built building for the Ministry of External Affairs, completed in 2010, will be demolished and it will now function from one of the square doughnuts. The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) building, completed in 2002, will also be demolished and rebuilt at another site, to make way for three square doughnuts. The National Museum will be torn down and its collection rehoused in North and South Blocks. Vigyan Bhawan will be demolished and rebuilt at another site "" all this to make place for the construction of more doughnuts. A new Prime Minister's residence and office complex will replace the 7 Lok Kalyan Marg complex that was only recently refurbished at great cost to serve as a permanent residence for Prime Minister Modi.

Where are the cost-benefit analyses to support these extravagant decisions?

A new distancing formula

In addition to these shortcomings, the Modi government's grand project also overlooks one of the most important urban design characteristics of Central Vista, which is that after Independence, this imperial symbol was transformed into a democratic public place.

While the trees, water channels and lawns of Central Vista are proposed to be retained, the ten square doughnut-shaped office towers flanking it will accommodate important government offices. It will inevitably be turned into a gated security zone like the plaza between North and South Blocks and the C-Hexagon, thus restricting its use and depriving thousands of local citizens of a popular leisure area.

At a time when India is confronting serious economic problems, reinforced by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, the clamour to suspend such profligacy is certainly justified, not only in economic terms but on moral and ethical grounds as well. But from an architectural and urban design perspective, should the Rs 20,000 crore, which the Central Vista revamp project is estimated to cost, be squandered to commit urban harakiri and make a banal lifestyle statement? No, the plan should be scrapped.

559,https://theprint.in/opinion/central-vista-needs-revamp-but-here-are-7-non-covid-reasons-why-modi-govt-has-got-it-wrong/658657/,"The Central Vista project in the heart of the capital has been universally panned. Before one gets into how the project is all wrong, there is something to be said for change. First, the Modi government is not the first one to say that Parliament House is now unsafe. Nor is it that the Central Vista is a great sight today. The place is unfriendly to visitors, parked cars have encroached wholesale on green areas, and there is poor land use in a prime area. The Bhavans"" themselves are functional but in various stages of disrepair. People have played around with flooring material and office lay-out, the doors and windows show their age, and toilets often stink. There is almost no central air-conditioning, which in this day and age should be essential. The security arrangements are haphazard and repetitive. The whole place needs a makeover, internal redesign, and better maintenance.

So, a project that promises better land use, better connectedness between buildings, space for underground parking, and central air-conditioning has something to say for itself. Does that justify the Central Vista project in its current form? Not at all. For a start, the project shows a lack of respect for history, even if an inalienable part of it is colonial history. Second, re-doing buildings or putting up new ones is a good time to review work processes, as the two have to be in alignment. If the intention is to switch to open office plans and fewer work silos (as Narendra Modi has wished), does the government want to switch to a desk-officer system with just two levels of decision-making, as the first Administrative Reforms Commission suggested half a century ago "" implying an end to the current file-movement system of working? No such review has been done.

Third, old signature buildings can be repurposed, and re-built inside out for the modern age with greater structural strength and without changing the external profile, as has been done with the White House, the Bundestag, and many others much older than the Lutyens-Baker buildings. If the Lok Sabha chamber is too small to accommodate more members (as may become necessary), the Central Hall can be made the lower house. Fourth, some of the temporary"" barracks dating back to World War II can make way for parking towers, with a park and ride system initiated, to get rid of the current parking mess.

Fifth, there is no particular merit in wanting all government offices close together; it might even be a security risk. Indeed, contrary to the logic of congregating offices, the new Army headquarters will be far away, in the city's cantonment area, while the air headquarters remains where it is "" though the defence services are integrating both planning and operations. Nor is uniformity of building design a virtue; consider the architectural variety of the Washington Mall. And sixth, how will the millions of priceless artefacts and fragile collections of the National Museum and National Archives be logged and stored safely before being re-housed in North Block and South Block, which may be unsuitable as museums, especially if they are unsafe?

Of eye-sores and wasteful expansiveness

Finally, newer government buildings have tended to be inferior to older ones. They are either eye-sores (like Sena Bhavan, the current Army headquarters, and Lok Nayak Bhavan not far away), or adopt a wasteful expansiveness: The defence research building behind South Block, the Comptroller and Auditor General's new head office a few kilometres away, and the new home of the External Affairs Ministry, built on the assumption that prime land is both costless and limitless. Individual offices in some of these buildings (including those in the Lodi Road Institutional Area, another unsightly congeries) are bigger than a badminton court. How does one avoid a repetition of this history, or its descent into vandalism of a historical area?

In short, why should such an important project, massive in scale, conceived in secrecy, shared selectively with small groups but shut out of the public eye, without considering cheaper and better alternatives, be executed in the midst of a pandemic when every rupee that can be spared should go into improving the country's medical capabilities?

Much has been said about the Central Vista Redevelopment Program by now. Currently the project is under fire from the opposition. A part of the criticism is rightly justified. A part, pure politics. Positive or negative may be the reasons, architecture is making headlines on a regular basis, in the midst of a horrible second wave and for all the wrong reasons.

This is a rarity in India, where art and architecture are rather elite affairs. General people hardly talk about them.

Pandemic or no pandemic, to begin with, was such a project really required? I won't get into the physical necessities of this project. The architect of the project Ar. Bimal Patel has addressed this multiple times, including a webinar on the ThePrint. Every regime leaves behind its marks. Some are known for the infrastructure they developed. Some leave behind marks through the intangibles of social upliftment or a cultural renaissance. Architecture has been a favourite for this purpose. Be it Rajaraja Chola's Brihadeshwara Temple, or Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri, or Nehru's Chandigarh. Why should the current regime shy away? Projects like these are moments of rejoice in the architecture fraternity. But without the pandemic.

Opposition is clamouring for postponing or even abandoning the 'wasteful' activity. The funds, 20,000 Cr, it is argued can be diverted towards the pandemic. Allocated funds for such projects are not released at one go, but in phases. Putting an end to this redevelopment does not necessarily mean that the Rs 20000 Cr are now available and can be diverted towards our health infrastructure.

But there is much more to this than such logic.

Architecture is not just about the brick and mortar used, and how beautiful the fa�ade is. Neither is it just about how well the building functions, or the costs involved. These factors are just the skin, flesh and bones of architecture. Deep down, and all pervading the space is its soul. This soul is an echo of the passion of the patrons, the designers and the builders. It is an accumulation of the memories of the inhabitants. It imbibes in itself the emotions of the visitors. The Red Fort at Delhi has seen all the ups and downs India has seen, ever since its inception. It saw the splendour and the loot. The neglect and the resurrection.

The Flag Hoisting every Independence Day celebrates not its brick and mortar existence, but its soul, so deeply connected to that of our Nation. The Central Vista Redevelopment will echo everything India is at the present. Including, unfortunately, the situation we are in due to the pandemic.

We do have many precedents to study from. Manish Tewari has compared the project with Hitler's Germania. But that is too harsh a comparison. Take the case of a much smaller structure in Pune, the Mahatma Phule Mandai. The structure, was opposed by stalwarts like Lokmanya Tilak and also, ironically, by Mahatma Phule himself. They cited this project as a wastage of funds, which could be diverted to education and social upliftment. Memories fade with time. Today the structure stands tall as one of the icons of Pune. Lokmanya Tilak's statue now stands in front of the structure. And it bears the name of Phule. But that's another story. Different scale and context.

The Central Vista might not be so fortunate. All the opposition to the project prior to the pandemic would have drowned with time had there been no second wave of this scale. The people who opposed yesterday, would happily use the place tomorrow. The problem lies in what's happening today.

Of course there is the health risk involved with the workers being on site. Risking the life of even one worker contributing to the new icon of the country is unjustified. It certainly is not an essential service at this point.

The story of this redevelopment will always have chapters of how we were preparing for moments of rejoice amidst horrors. These stories will cling to the soul of the project. It will be looked at with contempt by at least a generation.

Our ancient scriptures on architecture say that a Sthapati is a descendant of Vishwakarma, who in turn is a descendant of Brahma. This association has a deep significance. It puts the Sthapati, the creator of the Vaastu in the shoes of the Creator of the universe. It signifies that this act of creation is as pure as the creation of the universe. This act is pure, architecture is pure. This purity stands to be polluted.

A pause to the construction work can avoid this. Continuing the construction will ensure timely completion. But a pause will ensure something bigger. Save the soul of the project.

The new Parliament building will have a triangular shape and is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022. The government plans to hold the monsoon session of Parliament in 2022 in the new building.

The construction work of the Parliament building has started,"" an official said.

PM Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building on Dec 10 last year.

Earlier this week, a 14-member heritage panel gave its approval to the new Parliament building while also giving the go-ahead to the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to seek prior approval from the panel and other relevant authorities before starting the construction of the new building.

The construction work could not start earlier as the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decided the pending pleas on the issue.

The new building is being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd. The project is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.

Tata Projects Ltd. said despite the 35-day delay in the commencement of the construction work, it is confident that it will be able to deliver the project on or before time.

Our plans of action are already in place to accelerate the schedule by augmenting resources like skilled manpower and formwork etc,"" said Sandeep Navlakhe, vice president and business unit head of Tata Projects Ltd.

Our reinforcement required to be placed in the raft and walls are already made ready. Other off-site activities like procurement of stone for external cladding, MEP LLEs, carpets, etc. happened during these 35 days. We are more than confident that we will be able to deliver this building to the nation on or before time,"" he said.

The new structure will come up in front of the existing Parliament that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.

The new Parliament building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have an additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.

According to the plan, provisions will be made in furniture for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the Speaker.

Besides the new Parliament building, the redevelopment of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's Residence and Prime Minister's Office, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

The good: A fine promotional video of the renovated and renamed 'Kartavya Path' on all channels "" never did Delhi's Raisina Hills look lovelier. Watch out for this evening's inauguration "" should be quite a spectacle.

Also good: Fulsome coverage of the bad news from what NewsX called 'Blurundated' after 'Monsoon Fury' flooded Bengaluru (Times Now).

We'll return to this in a bit.

The bad: Oh, so many examples, but let's start off with the virtually non-existent coverage of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India Tuesday and the two countries signing a river pact after 25 years. Is this what good neighbours do?

The ugly: Some coverage of the tragic road accident that killed industrialist Cyrus Mistry on Sunday. It began on a sober note with stills and videos of the damaged car at the accident site. Speculation on the cause of the crash was minimal as channels focussed more on Mistry's life and career.

The ugliness crept into Monday's 'special' reports: An eyewitness on India TV claimed that the car was speeding at 120-140 km, suggesting reckless driving "" but how would he know?

He then said, rather chillingly, Jaan nahi tha (there was no life left)"" in the passengers at the back who were not wearing seat belts. Times Now chose to be macabre: The accident led to the 'smashing' of their heads and shoulders, it claimed.

India Today's coverage was by far the worst: In the morning, its reporter said that it was a 'mystery' why the airbags for the rear seats didn't open. Perhaps he ought to watch his own channel where an auto expert explained that airbags are activated only when seat belts are worn.

Like other channels, India Today too showed the bodies being carried out of the car, but then it went a step further by showing stills of the two people who had been in the front seats "" Dr Anahita Pandole flung to the ground, and her husband Darius Pandole.

Really?

Equally ugly, although well-meaning, were the simulated visuals of what happens to people at the back with no seat belts on: You see this CGI skeletal figure thrown forward and then flung back "" wham. Very scary. Which is the purpose, of course, but surely the video can be a little less frightening? Children will have nightmares after watching it.

There was non-stop coverage of the incessant rains "" A very good story for TV channels every year"", one individual commented, acerbically (India Today). The words used to describe the impact of the rains tell you the story: 'Broken Bengaluru Sinking' (India Today), 'Urban India Nightmare (Mirror Now), 'Sinking Reality of Smart City' (Times Now) 

The public interviewed on phone calls at India Today and Times Now wearily reminded us that the 'Monsoon Mayhem' (India Ahead) occurs each year and demanded answers from the government. Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai promptly replied by blaming the rain (what else?) and previous Congress governments.

To indicate the depth of the flooding, reporters stood in knee-deep water to get a real-time experience of 'water water' on the roads. Visuals showed us temples, schools, 'Even the Vidhan Sabha' (Times Now) waterlogged "" and the 'posh' villas as the 'Wealthy Clamber Onto Boats', 'Techies on Tractors' to reach dry land (India Today).

Channels repeatedly showed us the alarming condition of the badly flooded IT industry area. If this is the plight of the 'Back Office of the World,' what about slum dwellers, wondered India Today. Can't say, any channel showed the slums, though.

TV can't get over BJP-AAP

There is too much continuing coverage of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Aam Aadmi Party battle over the alleged scam in Delhi's excise policy.

This is not just bad, but boring television too.

The BJP 'sting' video of a man "" who it claimed is the father of a liquor vendor named by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and who allegedly admitted there were kickbacks to the AAP (phew!) "" was so blurry that it provided no clear proof of anything. Nevertheless, news channels telecast it for most of Monday, especially Republic TV.

Tuesday's live footage of the BJP protests in Delhi over the 'scam' was pretty pointless "" there are protests across India every day, so what's so special about this one? Perhaps it's because the protests occurred in Delhi and therefore needed preferential treatment? We all know of Doordarshan, but why must we have a daily Delhi-darshan?

The other two topics that excited news channels were Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's meeting with the opposition party leaders in Delhi and the Congress' 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' flagged off on Wednesday. Times Now put it rather well: 'Rahul Leads Bharat Jodo, Nitish Vipaksh Jodo'.

The latter saw much fanfare and flag-hoisting as Rahul Gandhi and his band of leaders set off on their journey through 12 states. TV news channels, cheekily, asked if the yatra was to unite the country or his 'splintering' party (India Today).

Ahem.

Views are personal.

564,https://theprint.in/opinion/why-central-vista-project-stirred-a-debate-before-sc-nod-and-necessity-of-urban-renewal/581070/,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court Tuesday cleared the Narendra Modi government's Central Vista redevelopment plan that includes the construction of a new Parliament complex.

In episode 655 of Cut The Clutter, ThePrint Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta explained that while most of the buildings in the initial or original Lutyens' zone will remain, the bhawans that house ministries will be demolished.

As governments expanded, more offices have come in, more ministers have come in, more and more partitions have been built, there is a shortage of everything it is quite a messy place. And it needs modernisation. That's being done. But this was challenged by several people on different grounds,"" Gupta said.

He explained what the Central Vista Redevelopment Project is, why it is being challenged, what urban renewal is and what judicial activism means in the wake of the apex court judgment.

The project, the problems & the judgment

While the North Block, South Block and the Parliament building will not be demolished, they will cease to be functional offices and be turned into museums.

Parliament will shift to a new building "" a triangular, four-storey structure with a seating capacity of 1,224. The Prime Minister's Office, defence ministry, external affairs ministry and finance ministry, among others, will also be shifted to a new symmetrical, interconnected"" complex of towers that will be built in the stead of the offices.

Highlighting the issues raised around the project, Gupta said according to activists this has been too hasty, not enough public debate has taken place and data about the project that is significant in terms of heritage has not been made public.

Moreover, this has also been challenged on the grounds that this is not the time to put resources into something like this"" and the clearances from the expert appraisal committee on environmental grounds was also taken for granted.

So, it is this alleged arbitrariness of the process that led to it being challenged, he said.

The three-judge bench of the Supreme Court that presided over the judgment included Justices Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjeev Khanna.

Sanjeev Khanna had dissented but Khanwilkar, Maheshwari said in the judgment that it is not for us to go into the details and the wisdom of spending this money. But if you say that the master plan of Delhi has been violated then remember the Master Plan itself calls for optimal use of public land,"" Gupta said, outlining the judgment.

Justice Sanjeev Khanna dissented on three grounds "" inadequate public participation, prior approval of the heritage committee not taken, and expert appraisal committee permission was taken for granted.

On urban renewal

Gupta argued, Our cities need renewal, the entire subcontinent has among the worst cities in the worldyou can have a gated colony or gated street. But beyond that our cities lack character, they lack quality of life.""

Redevelopment projects, he justified, have always been viewed suspiciously, the case in point being the Amravati project that was finally waylaid.

But then there are projects that have come up in Mumbai, Varanasi and Delhi that aim to redevelop the inner city. Gupta said these projects serve as an impetus for other inner city development projects around heritage areas.

The fact is that the Government of India needs better offices, more efficient offices, safer offices for fire, safer offices for surveillance,"" he said.

He, however, contended that it is true that Narendra Modi and his system is used to gigantism bordering on megalomania"". But, it is a different debate whether India needs to spend that money right now.

On the postlude

In the postlude to their judgment, Justices Maheshwari and Khanwilkar had written that the petitioners called upon the judiciary to venture into territories that are way beyond the contemplated powers of a Constitutional Court"".

They said the route of public/social interest litigation is increasingly being invoked to call upon the court to examine concerns of policy.

Why did you take up this case in the first place, was Gupta's reaction to the postlude.

He, however, highlighted another part from the postlude in which the judges said the constitutionally envisaged system of checks and balances has been completely misconstrued and misapplied in this case.

If these lessons have been applied then a lot of the things our courts have wasted time on they would have saved the time from cricket to air quality to cracker ban to dance bar to coastal road in Bombay (Mumbai),"" he said.

He added, The fact is that in this case the court is giving a sermon to itself, I would say that it is a good sermon and I would hope that more judges listen to it and follow it now.""

565,https://theprint.in/judiciary/sc-approves-central-vista-project-but-asks-centre-to-get-prior-approval-from-heritage-panel/579608/,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court Tuesday approved the Central Vista project, paving the way for the government to start construction work on one of its ambitious projects that is estimated to be worth over Rs 20,000 crore.

A three-judge bench by 2:1 majority held there were no infirmities in clearances granted for the project.

Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, writing for himself and Justice Dinesh Maheswari, however, said authorities executing the project will have to get clearance from the Heritage Conservation Committee, rejecting the Centre's stand that the approval was to be taken subsequently.

The court also said the exercise undertaken by the central government in change of land use of the project's master plan 2021 is legal and valid.

The bench confirmed all the notifications issued in this regard and declared the recommendation by the Environmental Committee as just and legal"". It called upon the Ministry of Environment to set up smog towers as an integral part of the Central Vista project and ordered use of environment-friendly construction material.

On the award of contract to a Gujarat-based firm, the court held it was just and proper.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna penned the minority opinion, but agreed with the other judges on the award of the project. He disagreed on the change in land use in the master plan and suggested remitting the matter back for public hearing. On the aspect of environmental clearance, the judge said the agency concerned had given a non-speaking order. The judge also held that prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee was necessary for such projects.

The bench had on 5 Nov 2020 reserved its verdict on the validity of the project that envisages redevelopment of 86 acres of land in Lutyens' Delhi.

The court had then refused to accept petitioners' request to stay the project until it delivered its verdict.

On 7 Dec, however, the court took an undertaking from the Centre that no construction work would begin at the site earmarked for the new Parliament complex, part of the Central Vista project.

In an urgent hearing conducted a day after Lok Sabha speaker announced 9 Dec as the date for the ground-breaking ceremony for the new building, the bench said the fact that there is no stay does not mean that construction can go on.

The judges, visibly miffed over the announcement, said only the foundation stone can be laid or paper work for the project can be processed. At this, solicitor general Tushar Mehta assured the bench that no trees would be cut or physical changes to the structure would be done.

The challenge

According to the proposal, the redevelopment of the Central Vista area will involve construction of a new Parliament house, a new residential complex for the Prime Minister and vice-president and 10 administrative buildings for all government ministries. It also includes converting the existing North and South blocks into museums. The project also proposes development of the Central Vista that connects Rajpath to the India Gate.

The petitioners before the Supreme Court challenged a notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on 21 Dec 2019, regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment.

While issuing notices on the petition, the apex court had refused to stay the project but made it clear that its validity will be subject to the outcome of the petitions before it.

Broadly, the petitioners argued that DDA was not vested with the power to bring change to land-use, assailing the alterations envisaged by the Centre. There was also a challenge to the manner in which public hearings were held before notifications were issued to change the land use. It was argued that the hearings were a mere formality, devoid of any meaningful consequences.

Environmental concerns due to redevelopment were also highlighted by the petitioners before the top court.

'Central Vista Project not a wastage of money'

The new Central Vista project is not a wastage of money but will save public funds worth Rs 1,000 crore that the administration has been spending annually on rent expenditure, the Centre had said, defending the project.

It also argued that a new vista was an absolute necessity as there was acute stress on the old central secretariat and Parliament building that were in a dilapidated condition.

The current parliament building, which was opened in 1927, does not adhere to fire safety norms, has a serious space crunch, is not earthquake-proof and is not equipped with modern security infrastructure to avoid a repeat of incidents such as the 2001 Parliament attack, the court was told.

Regarding construction of the new Central Secretariat, the government underscored the need to bring all important ministry offices under one single building.

All necessary statutory approvals including environmental clearances were in place and the project cannot be scrapped merely because the petitioners felt a better process or method could have been adopted, the government said, opposing the petitioners' argument that the Centre violated settled norms and guidelines for such projects.

566,https://theprint.in/india/rajpath-central-vista-lawns-to-be-renamed-as-kartavya-path/1117505/,"New Delhi [India], Sep 5 (ANI): The government has decided to rename the historic Rajpath and central vista lawns in New Delhi as 'Kartavya Path', sources said on Monday.

Government of India to rename New Delhi's historic Rajpath and Central Vista lawns as 'Kartavya Path',"" a source said.

The sources said that New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has convened a special meeting on Sep 7 with the objective of renaming the Rajpath and Central Vista lawns as Kartavya Path.

Rajpath was formerly known as Kingsway. It is the celebrated venue of the Republic Day parade every year and stretches through Vijay Chowk to India Gate.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Independence Day speech this year, had given 'panch pran' (five vows) call to citizens during 'Azadi Ka AmritKaal' and one of the resolves was duty of the citizens"". He had also stressed on the abolition of symbols relating to colonial mindset. Both these factors can be seen behind the naming of 'Kartavya Path'.

In his speech, the Prime Minister urged people to focus attention on 'Panch Pran' for the coming 25 years.

You have to concentrate on your resolve and strength. And we must take up the responsibility of fulfilling all the dreams of the freedom fighters by embracing those 'Panch Pran' by 2047 when the country celebrates 100 years of independence,"" he said.

Speaking of 'Panch Pran', he said that the first vow is for the country to move ahead with a big resolve and make India a developed country,.

The second pran is that in no part of our existence, not even in the deepest corners of our mind or habits should there be any ounce of slavery. The third pran is that we should feel proud of our heritage and legacy. Fourth pran, which is equally important, is unity and solidarity. The fifth pran is the duty of the citizens, in which even the Prime Minister, Chief Minister cannot be exclusion as they are also responsible citizens and have a duty towards the nation. This virtue is going to be the vital life force if we want to achieve the dreams we have for the next 25 years,"" he had said.

Elaborating on the fifth resolve, he said there should be success in the life of the individual, of the society, of the family, of the nation.

He said while it is the job of the government to make efforts to provide 24 hours electricity, it is the duty of the citizen to save as many units as he can.

While trying to understand all the countries in the world that have made progress; every country that has achieved something, even in personal life, few things emerged. One is disciplined life, and the other is devotion to duty. There should be success in the life of the individual, of the society, of the family, of the nation. This is the fundamental path and the fundamental vital force,"" he said.

It is the job of the government to make efforts to provide 24 hours electricity but it is the duty of the citizen to save as many units as he can. It is the responsibility and efforts of the government to supply water to every field, but a voice should come from each of my fields that we will move forward by saving water by focusing on 'per drop more crop',"" the Prime Minister said.

He said if everyone performs the duties of a citizen, the country can achieve the desired goals ahead of time.

It is our duty to do chemical-free farming, organic farming and natural farming. Whether it is police or people, ruler or administrator, no one can be untouched by this civic duty. If everyone performs the duties of a citizen, I am sure that we can achieve the desired goals ahead of time,"" he said. (ANI)

A bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh also slapped a fine of Rs one lakh on the petitioners for filing what the court described as a motivated petition"" and not a genuine one.""

The fact that the petitioners approached the court against the Central Vista project only and did not question construction activities undertaken by other civic agencies pointed to their ill-intent"" and lack of bonafide,"" the court held.

Emphasising that time is of the essence of the contract,"" the bench chided the petitioners for requesting to extend the deadline of an essential project"" of national importance.

The court said the agency carrying out the construction work followed all the curfew norms imposed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on 18 Apr.

Such kind of arguments cannot be accepted by this court, keeping in view that the construction activity of this essential project or of a project of national importance cannot be stopped especially when the conditions imposed by the order of the DDMA dated 19th Apr, 2021 thereof are not flouted or violated,"" the court ordered. The reasoning by the court was based on Centre's affidavit filed in the case in response to the PIL.

What the petitioners said

Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, had moved the HC to halt the ongoing Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project, part of the main Central Vista Project.

The Rs 20,000-crore project involves the construction of a new Parliament, new residences for the prime minister and vice-president, and 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, as part of the Central Secretariat Project.

They argued that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, could be put on hold in light of the pandemic. Petitioners' counsel, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, had argued they were not seeking to overreach the Supreme Court's Jan judgment that permitted the Central Vista, and that the plea to stop the construction was limited to the peak phase of the pandemic.

The Centre said that the petition is an attempt to halt the project with oblique motives.

The bench had reserved its order after hearing both sides on 17 May.

'Public vitally interested in this project'

The court discarded the petitioners' argument that the ongoing construction of a part of the main project is not an essential activity. And, if a sub-set of the main project is stopped midway then the main project cannot be completed within the stipulated time, the court observed.

By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the Central Vista Project (which is the main project) or Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project is not an essential project. The Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project which is a subset of the main project is equally important and essential as the main project,"" noted the judgment.

Heavily relying on the Centre's affidavit, the HC said the project was assigned to the agency and the work has to complete on or before Nov 2021. Public is vitally interested in this project,"" the judgment noted.

It accepted the Centre's and the agency's submission that adequate preventive measures had been put in place at the construction site, where arrangements are also made for the workers. Facilities provided at the site also include RT-PCR testing centres as well as isolation rooms in case of anyone getting infected.

All such steps indicate compliance with the DDMA orders and guidelines, the court remarked.

It said: Looking to the respective stands of the Respondents and the measures taken on ground as well as the provisions of the various DDMA Orders, we find that the petitioners have not been able to substantiate the allegations made in the writ petition and/or the alleged breach or violation of the DDMA orders.""

In view of the aforesaid aspect of the matter, since the workers who are working at the project are staying on the site, no question of issuing directions to suspend the work of Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project, whatsoever, arises, held the court.

569,https://theprint.in/judiciary/ed-gujarat-uapa-central-vista-justice-khanwilkars-6-year-establishmentarian-legacy-at-sc/1088322/,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court judgment upholding several controversial amendments to provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), backing the powers of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), came under fire from various quarters almost as soon as it was delivered last month.

Among other things, the verdict upheld stringent bail provisions under the law, and the wide powers given to the ED to arrest an individual. It also upheld provisions in the PMLA that reserve the burden of proof on defendants, effectively placing the onus on an accused to disprove guilt, as against the usual rule that the prosecution needs to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

In the days that followed, the verdict was criticised as an affront to personal liberty, with academician Pratap Bhanu Mehta writing that rather than being the guardian of rights, the Supreme Court is now a significant threat to it"".

In Parliament, Congress MPs sloganeered against the alleged misuse of the ED by the central government.

This verdict was one among many controversial judgments delivered by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, 65, over the course of his six-year tenure at the Supreme Court.

The judge retired on 29 Jul, leaving behind a string of judgments that, according to critics, were largely in line with the stance of the Modi government.

Senior advocate Dushyant Dave told ThePrint that Justice Khanwilkar's legacy is very disappointing"", while senior advocate Meenakshi Arora said his PMLA judgment made all of us feel he's brought ADM Jabalpur back"".

The ADM Jabalpur verdict was delivered in Apr 1976, during the Emergency. In a controversial order, the Supreme Court ruled that during an Emergency, nobody could seek any relief from a court as the fundamental right to personal liberty had been suspended "" not even if the order of detention was without authority of law or was mala fide or unauthorised.

Born in Pune in 1957, Khanwilkar began his practice as a lawyer in Feb 1982 and was elevated as a judge of the Bombay High Court in Mar 2000. He served in the court for over a decade before taking charge as chief justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court on 4 Apr 2013.

He was then appointed as chief justice of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Nov 2013.

Justice Khanwilkar was elevated to the Supreme Court in May 2016 and was part of several crucial benches, including the constitutional benches that decided the landmark Aadhaar (2018) and Sabarimala (2018) cases.

During his years at the Supreme Court, his judgments upheld the constitutional validity of the Modi government's amendments to the PMLA and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA).

Orders issued by benches of which he was a part also made getting bail much more difficult for anyone booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and enabled state action against petitioners.

In his final two years in the apex court, Justice Khanwilkar "" the third most senior judge in the Supreme Court before his retirement "" was part of benches that decided at least three crucial cases.

Green light for Central Vista

In Jan 2021, Justice Khanwilkar authored a judgment paving the way for the Central Vista redevelopment project. He was joined in his majority opinion by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, while Justice Sanjiv Khanna dissented.

Nine months before passing this judgment, Justices Khanwilkar and Maheshwari had, in Mar 2020, suo motu transferred all petitions filed before the Delhi High Court challenging the Central Vista project to the apex court.

Foreign funding for NGOs

In Apr this year, another three-judge bench headed by Justice Khanwilkar upheld amendments to the FCRA, reinforcing a tougher screening mechanism for receipt and utilisation of foreign funds by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

The judgment asserted that there is no dearth of donors within our country"", and that the aspirations of any country cannot be fulfilled on the hope (basis) of foreign donation, but by firm and resolute approach of its own citizens"". It had also said that receiving foreign donations cannot be an absolute right"".

Scope of ED's powers

Two days before he retired, Justice Khanwilkar authored the judgment rejecting 241 petitions challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the PMLA, 2002.

The judgment "" viewed as a shot in the arm for the ED "" upheld stringent bail conditions for anyone booked under the law on charges of money laundering, as well as the imposition of the burden on the accused to prove innocence.

It further upheld the scope of powers granted to the ED on a range of issues, including search and seizure, admissibility of confession statements made before the agency, and waiving the requirement for the agency to supply a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (FIR equivalent for ED) to the accused.

Bail under UAPA

The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, is an outlier, given that in regular criminal cases, bail is the norm and pre-trial jail the exception.

However, Section 43D(5) of the UAPA says that a person accused of an offence under Chapters IV (terrorism) and VI (belonging to a terrorist organisation) shall not be released on bail if the court, after perusing the case diary and police report, is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true"".

In Apr 2019, the interpretation of this provision by a bench led by Justice Khanwilkar "" in the Zahoor Watali case "" made getting bail even tougher under the UAPA.

The Delhi High Court, while hearing the case made out against Kashmiri businessman Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), had granted him bail in 2018 under this UAPA provision.

In doing so, the HC noted that while the investigating agency did have material against Watali, a lot of it was not admissible as evidence at the stage of trial.

The following year, however, the Supreme Court called the HC's approach inappropriate"".

The bench observed that, at the stage of bail, the high court was not required to weigh the evidence against an accused, and that it was only supposed to look at the material provided by the agency in its entirety and assess if there was a prima facie case.

This meant that, at the stage of bail, lower courts could not look into whether the evidence being produced against an accused "" like unsigned, untraceable documents "" would be admissible during trial.

The apex court has since faced criticism for its interpretation of this provision, with criminal lawyer Abhinav Sekhri pointing out that the Supreme Court actively chose a legal position that makes lengthy undertrial detention more likely"".

Since Apr 2019, the judgment has been cited in almost all UAPA judgments to reject bail to the accused, including in the Delhi riots and the Bhima Koregaon cases.

Justice Khanwilkar has another connection to the Bhima Koregaon case "" a judgment he delivered in Sep 2018, months after the first few arrests in this case.

In Aug 2018, historian Romila Thapar and four other scholars approached the Supreme Court, demanding an independent probe into the case and complaining against the alleged high-handedness"" shown by Pune Police, which initially investigated the case.

However, these petitions were rejected by a 2:1 majority, with Justice Khanwilkar authoring the majority verdict and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud dissenting.

Penalising petitioners

In his last two months on the bench, Justice Khanwilkar delivered two judgments that were interpreted as grounds for the state machinery to proceed against petitioners who approached the court.

On 24 Jun, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Khanwilkar rejected claims of a larger conspiracy"" in the 2002 Gujarat riots and dismissed petitioner Zakia Jafri's plea challenging a special investigation team's clean chit to then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi. The verdict also said those who kept the pot boiling""for ulterior design"" should be put in the dock"".

Against usual convention, the judgment did not mention the name of the judge who authored it.

A day after this judgment, an FIR was lodged by the Detection of Crime Branch in Ahmedabad against Jafri's co-petitioner Teesta Setalvad, retired IPS officer R.B. Sreekumar and former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt.

While Setalvad and Sreekumar were arrested right away, Bhatt "" who was already lodged in prison in connection with a 27-year-old case "" was arrested last month.

On 14 Jul, another bench led by Justice Khanwilkar and Justice J.B. Pardiwala slapped a fine of Rs 5 lakh on an activist who had filed a petition seeking a CBI probe into alleged extrajudicial killings by Chhattisgarh Police and central security forces during anti-Maoist operations in Dantewada in 2009.

The court also allowed the central government's application to initiate a probe to identify and prosecute those who gave false statements blaming the security forces and may have conspired in this"".

Petitioner Himanshu Kumar subsequently claimed publicly that he would not pay the fine, saying, I know I will go to jail. Paying the fine would mean accepting that I did something wrong.""

Sabarimala U-turn

Justice Khanwilkar was also a part of two major five-judge Constitution benches in Sep 2018.

One of these benches upheld the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, while striking down a few individual provisions of the law.

Another bench "" with a 4:1 majority "" lifted the ban that prevented women and girls between the age of 10 and 50 years from entering the hilltop shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa in Kerala's Sabarimala, ruling that the centuries-old religious practice was illegal and unconstitutional.

Then Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and Justices Khanwilkar, Chandrachud, and Rohinton Nariman formed the majority, while Justice Indu Malhotra dissented. All judges wrote separate opinions, except for Justice Khanwilkar, who joined the opinion of the then CJI.

Review petitions were later filed, challenging this judgment. Reviews are usually heard by the same bench that delivered the original judgment. However, since Justice Misra had retired by then, he was replaced on the bench by the new Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.

In Nov 2019, this new bench "" by a 3:2 verdict "" decided to refer certain questions about the correctness of the Sabarimala judgment for interpretation to a larger bench. The three judges who formed the majority opinion were Justice Gogoi (who was hearing the issue for the first time), Justice Malhotra (who had dissented earlier), and Justice Khanwilkar.

While the other judges stuck to their earlier judgment, only Justice Khanwilkar doubted his own earlier judgment.

However, in both these cases, he did not pen a separate opinion, but chose to endorse the opinions authored by the Chief Justice at the time.

In a farewell function hosted for the judge by the Confederation of Alumni for National Law Universities Foundation (CAN Foundation) earlier this month, Justice Khanwilkar emphasised legal education as a tool for social change and spoke about how lawyers must work towards serving the cause of humanity.

In professional life, we must endure to become upright, honorable, and hard-working citizens serving the cause of humanity,"" he was quoted as saying.

'Legacy is very disappointing'

Commenting on Justice Khanwilkar's judgments, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said that the latter's legacy is very disappointing"".

The judicial approach that he has taken in his career, particularly after becoming the chief justice of Madhya Pradesh High Court and then coming to the Supreme Court, has been very disappointing,"" Dave told ThePrint.

A former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Dave referred to Justice Khanwilkar as very, very pro-establishment"".

As a judge, you have to be fiercely independent and not defend anything and everything"" Judges have to be mindful of everything, they just can't allow the executive to do whatever they want to do.""

Talking about Justice Khanwilkar's approach in the Zakia Jafri and Himanshu Kumar cases, Dave said, It was not just unconstitutional, not just illegal, not just improper, but I would say it was highly immoral. He sent a chilling message to the country"" It was disgraceful for the Supreme Court to have passed that judgment.""

The riots did take place in Gujarat"" Judges can't be oblivious to the reality of the state, they have to be conscious of what is happening around, they can't live in ivory towers,"" he added.

Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, meanwhile, termed Justice Khanwilkar's judicial approach fairly retrograde"".

First of all, the directions with respect to the people who had pursued the matter on behalf of the Gujarat riots victims, I think that order was unprecedented. It's a chilling effect. Tomorrow, nobody will stand up for anyone. You won't have good Samaritans,"" she told ThePrint.

As for his judgment on PMLA, Arora said: With his second judgment, on PMLA, all of us feel he's brought ADM Jabalpur back"" It's extremely anti-rights.""

India's death toll also crossed two lakh following 3,293 fresh fatalities, according to Union health ministry data updated on Wednesday.

Central Vista- not essential. Central Government with a vision- essential,"" he said in a tweet.

The Central Vista revamp project, which was announced in Sep last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, and it is targeted to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat, a part of the project, is likely to be built by 2024.

In another tweet, Gandhi lauded the common people for helping each other.

By helping each other, the common people show that to touch someone's heart one need not touch one's hands. Keep helping,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag #TogetherStronger"".

Gandhi asked people to continue helping each other and expose the reality of the blind system"".

The second wave of the coronavirus infection has put huge pressure on the public health system, with hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen, beds, medicines and equipment.

Gandhi and the Congress have been critical of the government's response to the COVID-19 crisis.

571,https://theprint.in/campus-voice/central-vista-is-nothing-but-shallow-symbolism-that-displays-govts-misplaced-priorities/567732/,"In 1911, our imperial overlords, the British, organised an event of such scale and grandeur that had few parallels in history. The event was the Delhi Durbar and was presided over by the reigning British monarch, King George V, and was attended by every ruling prince and nobleman in India, along with thousands of landed gentry and other persons of note.

The goal of the Durbar was twofold "" to commemorate the shift of British India's capital from the port town of Calcutta to Delhi and to present the British as the rightful and true successors of the Mughal rule in India. Therefore, it would not be wrong to extrapolate that the Durbar's true motivations were more symbolic than strategic.

This symbolism wasn't lost on the new capital's architects, Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who made sure that the entire city reflected the opulence and might of the British empire. Many Indian historians later wrote that the Durbar was perhaps one of the finer examples of an exercise in vanity"", even as the rest of the subcontinent suffered miserably under the oppressive British Raj.

While such an act of largesse using public money may have gone unquestioned under an imperial government, it's nothing short of absurd that the same thing is happening again under a democratically-elected government in independent India.

The Central Vista Project aims to redevelop and redesign the entire 'power corridor' of Lutyens Delhi with an estimated budget of Rs 20,000 crore. The project is slated to be completed by 2024 and will act as a fitting tribute to the nation, a marker for the 'New India' in the new century. This type of shallow symbolism is reminiscent of the Durbar and just displays the misplaced priorities of the government.

Such a staggering amount of money is being spent at a time when economists from both ends of the spectrum have been begging the government to offset the damages of a raging pandemic that, according to a report published by the United Nations, has reversed decades of progress in poverty, healthcare and education.

More pressing issues in national capital need attention

The government has argued that the project once completed will save the exchequer an annual rent expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore, with additional savings coming in through better planning and efficient use of resources. While all this is true, it must also be kept in mind that the implementation of this project is taking precedence over a range of other serious issues that the capital faces on a daily basis "" unbreathable air, fast depleting water table and the ever-increasing crime rate.

These are the issues that have disproportionately high consequences for citizens and will end up costing the exchequer infinitely more than whatever little the government plans to achieve by revamping the Central Vista.

In an election rally in 2016, the honourable Prime Minister remarked,  arey hum toh fakeer aadmi hai, jhola leke nikal lenge"" (We are poor men who will take a satchel and move). The remark, alluding to his humble background, was an instant hit with the masses who took great pride in his journey from a common chaiwala (tea seller) to the Prime Minister.

Today, when the masses are struggling with an unprecedented crisis that has left them lurching for survival, the Prime Minister would be well-advised to remember his 'fakiri' and delay, if not entirely cancel, the Central Vista project in order to help the people.

The complex will come up in a total built-up area of 2,26,203 square feet and is estimated to cost Rs 467 crore. Of the total built-up area, the PM's residence will be spread out over an area of 36,328 square feet.

Besides the prime minister's main residence on the ground and first floors, the complex located south of South Block will also contain the PM's home office, an indoor sports facility, support staff quarters, a Special Protection Group (SPG) office, and a Seva Sadan among other structures for utility, as well as a security office, ThePrint has learnt.

An important component of the complex will be a subterranean VIP tunnel that can be accessed from the PM's home office. It will directly connect the PM's residence to the Executive Enclave, which will house the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the new Parliament and the Vice-President's residence.

According to highly-placed government sources, the proposal to have a subterranean tunnel was made to help ease frequent traffic bottlenecks in the Central Vista area because of restrictions and barricading during the movement of the PM and his entourage.

The Union housing and urban affairs ministry, which is piloting the Central Vista Redevelopment project, has set a Sep 2024 deadline to complete and hand over the PM's Residence Complex. Government sources told ThePrint that the proposal is likely to come up soon before the finance ministry's Expenditure and Finance Committee (EFC) for approval. All publicly funded schemes and projects must be appraised and approved by the EFC.

The expenditure for constructing the complex will be met from the Union housing ministry's Budget grant. In the 2022-23 Budget, Rs 70 crore was allocated for the project.

The housing ministry has already got environmental clearance for the project, and other clearances are in the process. The tender for the construction of the complex is likely to be completed by Dec, the government sources said.

The sources added that the location of the new PM's Residence Complex was selected with an eye not only to bringing it closer to the PMO, the Cabinet Secretariat and the National Security Council Secretariat, but also to providing better segregation of high-security routes from general public movement.

The sources further said that the PM's present residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg is located some 3 km from the PMO. Any commute by the PM and his security entourage results in major disruptions to city traffic in the Central Vista area, and inconveniences the public. The new location will segregate the PM's route and help avoid traffic disruptions,"" one of the sources said.

What Central Vista redevelopment entails

The Central Vista revamp plan is one of the the Narendra Modi government""s most ambitious projects, aimed at giving Delhi's power corridor a complete makeover. The project includes constructing a new Parliament building, a Common Central Secretariat housing all the central government ministries and departments, as well as the Central Vista Avenue and the Executive Enclave.

Work is already underway to build a new triangle-shaped Parliament, which is expected to be ready by Nov, in time for the Winter Session. Besides this, work has also started on the Common Secretariat, which will have 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, including those of Shastri, Nirman, Udyog, Krishi and Vayu Bhawans. The PMO will be located in the Executive Enclave near the South Block, and it's estimated that it will cost approximately Rs 1,200 crore. The National Security Council Secretariat and the Cabinet Secretariat will also be housed in the Executive Enclave. The existing PMO in South Block will eventually be converted into a museum.

In a bid to outshine and leave indelible marks in history, PM Modi has always had the distinct reputation of bringing atypical and Machiavellian changes in the democratic framework of our nation.

While the country is in the throes of a pandemic, which has led to unprecedented uncertainty about the future, our PM launched his 'dream project' to construct a new Parliament House and 10 administrative buildings for all government ministries. The pandemic has exposed the dearth of proper healthcare facilities and infrastructure in the country and around the world, yet healthcare could not make it to the priority list of our government, which believes spending Rs 20,000 crore on the redevelopment of buildings will ensure a better future for Indians.

The vanity and extravaganza of the present government is audaciously boundless. While countries like France, Japan and Norway are all set to provide free vaccination to all its citizens, the Indian government could not even assure universal vaccination, let alone, free of cost availability.

The new house for the Prime Minister and Vice-President can wait and these funds could be utilised for this noble purpose instead of such acts of self-indulgence.

Subterfuge in Central Vista project

The lack of an expert opinion coupled with the secrecy and subterfuge behind sanctioning the project to a Gujarat-based firm of architects raise serious doubts about this endeavour.

One of the arguments of the government is that since the population of India has substantially increased, there will be a need to increase the seats of MPs in the near future. But renovation of the existing building could have been a better alternative to such lavish redevelopment. Moreover, the existing buildings, which are an epitome of our history and heritage, deserve preservation.

A serious concern in this regard was also shown by retired IAS and IPS officers who beseeched the PM, in a letter, to scrap the Central Vista project. Additionally, they zeroed in on the severe environmental degradation that the project would cause. They pointed out that the precinct is dense with mature tree canopies and vast lawns which serve as a repository of biodiversity in the overly polluted capital of the nation. The letter noted, This is against the basic tenets of the Master Plan of Delhi which stipulates that no new offices should be built in New Delhi and the efforts should be made to decongest it.""

This underscores the sheer misuse of taxpayers' money. The economy of the country was already dwindling, and with the advent of the Covid-19, the GDP has plummeted miserably. In such a scenario, calibrated efforts are needed to revitalise the economy. Many economists argue that those rendered destitute expected and needed financial aid and employment incentives from the central government. How will the new buildings, that cost several thousand crores, assuage the pain of millions of citizens?

The Modi government also owes various states a huge amount "" the shares of their GST revenues "" which are desperately needed funds. What justifies the haste of the central government for allocating funds for CVP instead of prioritising the economy?

Such a project undermines democracy

While Modi believes that the new Parliament will depict a new democratic India"" and an Atmanirbhar Bharat"", why is he turning a deaf ear to the clarion call of the farmers who are protesting for their rights in the same capital where he was busy laying foundation stone for the new buildings? Why is he ignoring the demands of old India that is still as democratic and, hopefully, will continue to be so on the 75th anniversary of Indian Independence when the project is expected to be completed.

The country needs more schools, more universities and more hospitals, a common man would hardly ever visit the grandiloquent Parliament in his lifetime.

The problems do not just end here. The nexus is obnoxiously interconnected. Not only does such a project undermine the democratic atmosphere, it also blatantly disrespects the other organs of the government, particularly the judiciary.

The apex court has stayed all construction and ancillary activities in the historically significant zone"" as its validity is under consideration because of the various petitions that have challenged this project. Until the final verdict, no construction, demolition or deforestation activities can be carried out.

Even though the Centre sought permission from the SC before laying the foundation stone, it still gives an impression that the government is almighty. Such activities suit dictatorships and not democracies like India.

574,https://theprint.in/judiciary/plea-against-central-vista-construction-another-attempt-to-stall-project-centre-to-delhi-hc/656364/,"New Delhi: The Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the PIL seeking stay on the construction of Central Vista here amid the raging COVID pandemic was just another attempt to stall the project which has been facing such attempts from the beginning on one pretext or another.

The intentions and motive"" behind filing of the plea are evident from the fact that the instant project has been singled out by the petitioners despite several other agencies, including Delhi Metro, carrying out construction activities across the national capital, the Centre has alleged.

The very fact that out of all these construction activities going on simultaneously for different projects by different agencies, the petitioner has chosen to be a public spirited citizen only with regard to one project only speaks volumes about his intentions and motive behind filing the present petition,"" the Centre's affidavit has contended.

Since the affidavit was not yet on record, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh listed the matter for hearing on May 12.

The court also allowed the early hearing application moved by the petitioners "" Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film maker "" who have contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.

In the affidavit filed in the court on May 10, the central government has said that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted construction activities, during the prevailing curfew, where the labourers are residing on-site.

It has said the workers were engaged well before the imposition of curfew on Apr 19.

It is submitted that in the meantime, a COVID compliant facility was installed at the worksite itself, to accommodate the 250 workers who had expressed their willingness to stay put and continue the aforesaid work.

The facility provides for strict implementation of COVID protocol strictly and also adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour, such as sanitization, thermal screening, physical/social distancing and masking,"" the government has said in its affidavit.

It has also said that the contractor has provided health insurance to all the concerned workers against COVID-19 and a separate facility for conducting the RT-PCR test, isolation and medical aid has also been set up at the site.

It is unequivocally stated that the workers working on the project as of now, are residing at the work site, following social distancing norms as well as other COVID-19 protocols.

It is false to suggest that any workers are brought from Sarai Kale Khan camp to the working site on a daily basis or otherwise and consequently, the entire substratum of the case of the petitioners is erroneous and based on falsehood,"" the government has said.

The high court on May 4 had adjourned the matter to May 17 saying it first wants to study the apex court's Jan 5 judgement giving a go ahead to the Central Vista project.

Thereafter, the petitioners had moved the apex court against the high court's May 4 order,

In the hearing before the apex court, they had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.

Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them, they had told the apex court.

The apex court had declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the high court.

It asked the petitioners to seek an early hearing before the high court and subsequently, they moved an application to advance the matter.

The petitioners have claimed before the high court that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.

Their plea has also contended that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.

The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

The 69 retired bureaucrats, under the aegis of Constitutional Conduct Group, claimed that the country's public health infrastructure was crying out for investment and asked why this wasteful and unnecessary project must take precedence over social priorities like health and education"".

The signatories included former IAS officers Jawhar Sircar, Jawed Usmani, N C Saxena, Aruna Roy, Harsh Mander and Rahul Khullar, and former IPS officers A S Dulat, Amitabh Mathur and Julio Ribeiro.

Notwithstanding the specious reasoning as to why a new Parliament building is at all necessary, it is a matter of great dismay that at a time when we are faced with an economy in perilous decline and a pandemic which has brought untold misery to millions, the government has chosen to invest vast sums on a project which represents nothing but the pursuit of pomp and grandeur,"" they said.

The central vista redevelopment project in the heart of the national capital envisages construction of a new Parliament complex, government buildings for central ministries, a new enclave for the vice president and a new prime minister's office and residence among others.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised its estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

We are writing to you today to convey our dismay at the manner in which your government, and you, as its head, have chosen to completely disregard the rule of law in the matter of the Central Vista Redevelopment project. This project, from its very inception, has been marked by a degree of executive highhandedness rarely witnessed before,"" alleged the letter.

Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the central vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,"" it further alleged.

The former civil servants also wondered what locus standi the prime minister has to lay the foundation stone of the Parliament building.

The prime minister is the head of the executive, not of the legislature. For a building that will accommodate the two Houses of Parliament, the appropriate protocol would have been for the President of India to lay the foundation stone. This was a clear instance of breach of constitutional propriety,"" the letter alleged.

Modi had on Dec 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building.

The signatories also alleged brazen impropriety"" in going ahead with the construction of the new Parliament building while the matter is still sub judice.

Puri said some minor works are currently being carried out at one or two underpasses, which are likely to be completed soon.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, the revamping of the three-kilometre-long Rajpath from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and a prime minister's office, and a new vice-president's enclave.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista Avenue is almost ready. Some minor works are being carried out at one or two underpasses. The project will be completed by Jul 15 or Jul 18,"" the minister told reporters on the sidelines of an event here.

Earlier this week, Puri had visited the stretch and said that Delhiites, who have warm memories of the place, would be pleasantly surprised to see how it is being totally transformed.

After his visit, the minister had said that the redeveloped Central Vista Avenue would have underpasses, vending zones, public amenities, pathways and green spaces, among other features.

On Jun 2, Puri had said that the Centre achieved the target of holding the Republic Day parade on a revamped Rajpath under the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project.

The first is old military uniforms and the second is the new Central Vista, both being something to take pride in. As the Army contingents, dressed in part in older uniforms of the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Mar through the Central Vista, it is bound to make every Indian's heart swell with pride.

Ever since I was a child, one has been hearing of buildings or structures having been constructed by the Mughals or other dynasties or the British. The Central Vista will give us the pride of this icon, this seat of power having been constructed during modern times by the Indian government and the people.

Soldier uniforms "" a matter of pride

The Army contingents will showcase the older versions of uniforms  Rajput Regiment contingent wearing the uniform as it was in the 50s, Assam Regiment in the uniforms of the 60s, and my regiment, the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry Regiment (JAKLI), will sport our uniform of the 70s, the one that I was commissioned in. The new digital disruptive pattern combat uniform of the Army is also making its debut. Soldiers take a great deal of pride in their uniforms.

As I said in my piece in Hindustan Times, uniforms are worn for symbolic value, recognition, or uniformity by educational institutions, workplaces, or organisations. In the armed forces, however, they denote discipline, equality, and respect. Soldiers take pride and find motivation in uniforms and badges, medals, and insignia. Why do uniforms evoke pride?

An army uniform gives the soldiers their identity. The badges of your regiment give you a sense of belonging. A regimental lanyard (a regimental colour drawstring worn on the shoulder, originally to carry a whistle) bonds you with your comrades, with whom you share bonds of life and death. The medals that soldiers wear on their chests are awarded for bravery during war or other operational duties.

A medal motivates. It is also revered. Veterans too wear the medals on ceremonial occasions. Even the next of kin are allowed to wear them on such occasions after the veteran passes away. That is the kind of love, importance, and pride attached to it.

A uniform is symbol of responsibility

In ceremonial uniforms, senior soldiers wear a sash and officers wear a pouch belt diagonally across their chest, on which are inscribed all the battle honours that the regiment won in the past. When a soldier wears a uniform adorned with all these accoutrements, it evokes immense pride in them and also places a great responsibility on them. They wear on their uniform what has been achieved by their predecessors, their forefathers. It is an onerous responsibility. They cannot do anything to let them down. They will always strive to add to the good name, which can only be done by performing their duty well, even at the risk of their own life. There is no additional incentive or financial bonus for doing this. That is the ultimate motivation.

When such motivated soldiers Mar past the citizens, they will reassure every Indian that the worst of the pandemic is behind them, and the country, the government, and the administration are capable of taking care of its citizens. The military might on display assures every citizen that we are fully capable of meeting all external threats.

It also sends out a statement to the world about India's capability regarding the protection that it can offer its own people and the role it can play as a dependable participant in the global community. This, in turn, evokes the confidence of other countries in its stability and leads to better economic growth and development. It sets up a positive spiral in the growth story of India.

PM Modi told the workers that he will invite all of them who worked on the redevelopment project of Central Vista for the Jan 26 Republic Day parade.

He also witnessed an exhibition on revamped Central Vista Avenue. Prime Minister Modi also unveiled a grand statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose near India Gate today. The jet black granite statue, with a height of 28 feet will be placed under the Canopy near India Gate. According to Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the move symbolises a shift from the erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power to the 'Kartavya Path' being an example of public ownership and empowerment.

These steps are in line with Prime Minister's second Panch Pran for New India in Amrit Kaal: remove any trace of the colonial mindset,"" said a PMO statement.

Over the years, Rajpath and adjoining areas of Central Vista Avenue had been witnessing pressure of increasing traffic of visitors, putting stress on its infrastructure. The PMO said that it lacked basic amenities like public toilets, drinking water, street furniture and adequate parking space. Further, there was inadequate signage, poor maintenance of water features and haphazard parking.

Also, a need was felt to organise the Republic Day parade and other National events in a less disruptive manner with minimal restrictions on public movement. The redevelopment has been done bearing these concerns in mind while also ensuring the integrity and continuity of architectural character,"" it said.

Kartavya Path will exhibit beautified landscapes, lawns with walkways, added green spaces, refurbished canals, new amenity blocks, improved signages and vending kiosks. Further, new pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting are some other features that will enhance the public experience.

It also includes a number of sustainability features like solid waste management, stormwater management, recycling of used water, rainwater harvesting, water conservation and energy-efficient lighting systems, among others. (ANI)

To be built with red and yellow Dholpur sandstone "" similar to that used in the new Parliament building "" the new PMO will come up on land where defence offices were located in hutments and barracks near South Block. The defence offices have already been shifted to two new office complexes on Africa Avenue and Kasturba Gandhi Marg.

The PMO will be part of what is being called the high-security Executive Enclave, which will also have offices of the cabinet secretariat, National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) and office spaces attached to the PM's residence.

India House, an independent structure with facilities for hosting state guests, will also be part of the Executive Enclave, a spokesperson for HCP Design, Planning and Management Limited, the Gujarat-based firm that won the bid to design the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, told ThePrint.

A new residence for the Prime Minister will also be built, but the design for it is yet to be finalised, government sources said. The sources added that the CPWD, the construction wing of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, will issue the financial bids for the Executive Enclave shortly. The housing ministry is piloting the Central Vista Redevelopment project.

The first stage of the pre-qualification process is already on. Because it's a high-security project, we are doing a two-stage bid process. Technical bids were issued in Nov last year. Only the qualified bidder will now be allowed to participate in the financial bid,"" a senior housing ministry official said.

Once the tender is awarded and work starts, it will take 24 months to complete the Executive Enclave project.

The existing PMO is housed in South Block, which will be eventually converted into a museum.

What the new PMO & Executive Enclave will look like

According to the project architects, the Executive Enclave will comprise multiple buildings, arranged in two facing, triangular plots. It will be an integrated complex, which will consolidate the PMO, the Cabinet Secretariat and the NSCS offices.

It will consolidate several important functions in one complex. The way these offices presently function, from distant locations, impede interactions amongst staff and cause disruptions to city traffic movement,"" the HCP spokesperson said.

The Prime Minister's Office will be housed in rectangular buildings, with internal courtyards. The National Security Council Secretariat and the Cabinet Secretariat will be linear buildings across a garden.

The Executive Enclave will be able to accommodate approximately 1,700 members of staff, across all buildings, which will be designed to incorporate all required security arrangements. The new facilities will also be equipped with the latest infrastructure and technology, according to the spokesperson.

Each building, i.e. the Prime Minister's Office, the NSCS, Cabinet Secretariat and India House, will be equipped with conference rooms according to their requirements. All buildings will have open floor layouts for workspaces.

The Executive Enclave will be a green complex, with the buildings designed to be energy efficient, the HCP spokesperson said. There will be a series of courtyards inside the buildings to maximise natural light and ventilation.

The exterior walls will be thicker, and openings will use two layers (glass and screen) to reduce heat gain. Terraces will be equipped with rainwater harvesting systems. Recycled water from sewage treatment plans will be used for landscape irrigation. The buildings will make use of efficient air conditioning systems and centralised garbage disposal systems,"" the spokesperson added.

Work also underway on office complexes, Vice President's House

Currently, under the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, work is underway to build a new Parliament and the Central Vista Avenue on Rajpath. The CPWD has also floated tenders for construction of three office complexes, part of the new Common Central Secretariat that will come up at the site where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts was earlier located. Tenders have also been awarded for a new Vice President's House.

The Central Vista revamp plan, one of the most ambitious projects of the Narendra Modi government to give Delhi's power corridor a complete makeover "" which has faced much criticism "" will also include 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, including Shastri Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan and Vayu Bhavan.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, which had been hearing a plea for suspending the ongoing construction work during the Covid pandemic, has fixed May 31 for delivery of its judgement on it, the high court's cause list revealed on Saturday.

The court had reserved its judgement on May 17 on the joint plea by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker.

The two had contended in their plea that the project was not an essential activity and can be put on hold for time being.

During the May 17 hearing, the Centre had termed the plea as a facade"" or a disguise"", aimed at stalling the project.

The petitioners on the other hand had contended they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area.

The petitioners' counsel had likened the project to Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II.

Hard hitting arguments against the maintainability of the plea were made during the hearing.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, had also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workforce.

Terming the Central Vista project as central fortress of death"" and comparing it to Auschwitz"", the petitioners' counsel Sidharth Luthra had contended that the Centre's claim on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre and other amenities on the site were all false.

He had said only empty tents have been pitched at the site and there were no beds for workers to stay or sleep there.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, however, had taken strong exceptions to the project being dubbed as Auschwitz and said one can criticise and be venomous"" about it but such terms should not be used in courtrooms.

Countering the petitioners' claims, the Centre's law officer had said one of the petitioners had been opposed to the project long before it got the go-ahead from the Supreme Court in Jan this year.

He said the petitioners were not concerned with the health and safety of workers at other construction sites in the city.

Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) about the health of workmen,"" he had added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.

He had said the petitioners cannot decide what is the safe timeline for completing the project and the company has to finish it by Nov so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.

The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the petition, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, had said.

The project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the Prime Minister and the Vice-President. It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries' offices.  PTI

586,https://theprint.in/india/central-vista-buildings-to-have-robust-fire-safety-system-as-seven-proposals-get-nod-2/1086876/,"New Delhi, Aug 17 (PTI) Buildings being constructed under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project will have a robust fire safety system in place, with the Delhi Fire Service giving its clearance to seven proposals in the last two years for structural plans that include a new prime minister's office and a new Parliament building, officials said on Wednesday.

They said that the stairwell pressurisation system, which is a mechanical ventilation, will also be in place in buildings like a new Parliament building, a new PMO building, amenity block and common central secretariat, besides Rajpath.

Most of the buildings under the Central Vista project have been divided into fire sub-compartments having fire resistant walls on all sides including top and bottom, which will help them contain fire within its origin, according to fire safety officials.

Delhi Fire Service Director Atul Garg said that the buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project will have a state-of-the-art technology as far as the fire safety is considered.

We have tried to provide the best infrastructure for the fire safety system. This is going to have in-built fire safety systems with a set up of a huge fire control room as well,"" Garg told PTI.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, the revamping of the three-kilometre-long Rajpath from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and a prime minister's office, and a new vice president's enclave.

The DFS director also said that all due precautions have been taken with reference to the fire safety system of the buildings.

Officials said that DFS's recommendations include an internal road for fire tenders movement besides provisions for a fire check door for the protection of exits and staircases.

Sanjay Kumar Tomar, Deputy Chief Fire Officer, said, the major recommendations include a fire safety arrangement, escape route and means of accessing and exiting the building in terms of number, width, type and arrangement of sufficient exits.

The proposals were cleared by the DFS after the building designs were presented for approval by the government. Each of the seven proposals consist of plans for more than two buildings which were cleared between 2020-2022.

Tomar said that various in-built fire-fighting arrangements have also recommended to be installed in the buildings such as a fire exit, a hose reel, a wet riser, hydrants, an automatic sprinkler system, internal hydrants and yard hydrants, pumping arrangements, and captive water storage for fire-fighting.

Automatic fire detection and alarming system, manual-operated electric fire alarm system and a public address system have been recommended in accordance with National Building Code of India Chapter 4 on fire and fire safety.

All the recommendations suggested are being followed and implemented in the building designs which had altered,"" the officer said.

According to fire department officials, initially it was not easy to convince the architects of the project to make certain specific changes in terms of fire safety system as they were of the view that any such changes could affect the beauty of the buildings.

However, after a lot of discussions and at least seven-eight rounds of meetings held with our retired service providers, architects and consultants involved in the project, they agreed to make all the necessary suggestions recommended by the fire department to ensure an efficient fire safety system,"" DFS director Atul Garg told PTI.

Fire compartmentation, protection of exits through fire check doors, fire resistant material for construction of buildings as per unified by laws 2016 were also made to be incorporated in the design of the buildings, he said.

The buildings will also have a smoke management system "" a very important provision to control smoke in case of fire, the fire officials said.

The buildings provide safe passage for the occupants and also facilitate fire-fighters to locate the origin of fire. This helps in controlling fire early leading to less damage, Tomar said.

Earlier this month, a CPWD official had said that all-out efforts are being made to finish the remaining work of the new Parliament building so that the Winter Session is held there.

Recently, the government told the Lok Sabha that 70 per cent of the physical progress of the new Parliament building project has been achieved and the targeted date of completion is Nov 2022. PTI AMP BUN VN VN

588,https://theprint.in/opinion/modis-central-vista-plan-shows-urban-planners-complicit-in-destroying-heritage/377464/,"Many decades ago, when I was studying urban planning at New York's Columbia University, I submitted an assignment on urban planning in India to my professor, Charles Abrams, who was a well-known expert on third-world urban development and a consultant to the UN. One remark he made was an epiphany. He said, if you scratched an Indian urban planner, you would find a fascist.

Abrams said this in the context of my repeated references to the need of using the police powers of the state to implement the master plans of cities. It was only on my return to India, and engaging with the profession, that I began to comprehend the significance of his prescient insight. It enabled me to honourably orient my engagement with a profession that I found was clinging on to authoritarian strategies to solve the urban problems of a transforming society.

It struck me that one of the defining objectives of Indian urban planning was to erase all manifestations of indigenous urbanism and impose a 'modern' order based on foreign models of urban development. This propensity has morphed in recent times to advocate the imperatives of 'smart' and 'world class' cities. People's modest quest for shelter and livelihood invariably failed to conform to the abstract ideals of planners, and consequently were branded as illegal and demolished. The urban planner and the administrators who manage cities, I realised, were ignorant of the meaning or significance of urban heritage, even as they simultaneously proclaimed with pride our '5,000-year urban history'. These paradoxes resurfaced in my mind when I learnt about the Narendra Modi government's audacious proposal to revamp the Central Vista in New Delhi.

A megalomania

Central Vista is defined as a heritage precinct in the Master Plan of Delhi, and its iconic character was recommended by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government for listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. The NDA government under Narendra Modi however, withdrew that application when it came to power in 2014 on the specious proposition that the heritage status would be 'anti-development'.

The first time Indians became aware of the Modi government's intent to 'revamp' Central Vista was in Sep 2019, when the Ministry of Urban Development invited bids for the appointment of a consultant for the Development/Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista at New Delhi"". The sudden revelation turned to shock when the objectives of the project sank in "" to create new iconic structures (that) shall be a legacy for 150  200 years at the very least  to represent the values and aspirations of a New India  Good Governance, Efficiency, Transparency, Accountability and Equity and is rooted in the Indian Culture and social milieu"". This evoked consternation given the well-known political agenda of the ruling party to erase 'colonial heritage'. The Modi government will be spending an estimated Rs 20,000 crore in four years following, what appears to be, a plan-as-you-go strategy.

One does not know whether to deal with this megalomania as a tragedy or a comedy. Apologist pointed out that every emperor built a new capital in Delhi, forgetting that our democratic republic is not ruled by an emperor. Not even the parliamentarians had an inkling about the dreams of the emperor. Others identified the many procedural and legal transgressions that abounded in the proposed scheme. Many such urban renewal projects are being proposed all over India to upgrade other cities, with similar contentious agendas. Often these projects originate on account of political visions, as in the case of the Central Vista project, but in all cases, its drafting and execution are the works of intelligent and professionally competent architects, urban planners and administrators. The Central Vista plan is being drawn up by architect Bimal Patel ""who Modi roped into work on everything from Gujarat to Varanasi.

Abram's observation only partially explains the nature of such exercises, but to understand the whole picture it is necessary to look deeper and examine a generic fault line endemic to Indian urban planning.

Also read: New home for PM, a triangular Parliament "" Modi govt readies Delhi power corridor makeover

'World-class' failings

In essence, this urban planning fault line can be described by paraphrasing Hannah Arendt, as 'the banality of routine'. Like decent people become complicit in perpetrating evil, urban planners in India also engage in, in an unreflective way, with projects that can be harmful and inimical to the welfare of society. These projects are seldom driven by the planner's analytical reflexivity, but by external agents, like an aggrandising political vision or benefits to be accrued from undertaking lucrative real estate projects. The planners in all cases are the cogs in the wheel.

The professional urban planner, engineer or architect does not take moral ownership of the work they do. It is the fault line in the profession, which is the root cause of the disjunction between professional means and societal ends. Perhaps, this moral ambiguity of urban planning in India emanates from the colonial origins of the profession, but it can't be a justifier even after 70 years after Independence.

Routine practices do not critically question strategies to plan local sites on foreign urban models. So, it is not surprising that the urban design scheme proposed for the Central Vista project does not respect the public character of this iconic public space of New Delhi. The project proponents are tone-deaf because, in defence, they strenuously emphasising the number of square meters that have added to the open area. In this manner, the extraordinary diversity of this and other historic cities are flattened by beautifying them to make them 'world class'.

The banality of routine views all urban problems in the country to be alike and amenable to similar solutions. It does not distinguish between the particular characteristics of the aging Central Vista in New Delhi or the congestion in Varanasi or commercialisation of Shahjahanabad. Conserving the cultural significance of historic precincts does not underpin the initiatives for its renewal.

Also read: Narendra Modi wants to rebuild New Delhi for no good reason

Banality of routine

Although conservation professionals in India have long cited the examples of historic cities in Europe where urban heritage is routinely and compellingly conserved while introducing contemporary amenities, this model of contextually sympathetic urban renewal is not followed in India. In urban planning parlance, the objective in the Indian context is to develop 'indigenous modernity' and not impose 'Eurocentric modernity' to upgrade local habitats.

In many recent projects to upgrade historic cities, including the Central Vista project, the universally acknowledged principles of good practices have been bypassed to achieve quick results. This results in straight forward beautification exercises to mimic 'world class' benchmarks, a process that is typically justified by the self-serving rationale that 'there is no alternative'.

In Varanasi, for example, the challenge of dealing with the dense urban fabric constituting the iconic character of the historic city was 'solved' by demolishing large swathes to create a grand landscaped plaza directly linking the Vishwanath Temple to the Ghats of the river Ganges. This design solution borrows more from Vitruvius, the Roman architectural grammarian, and Camillo Sitte, the late 19th century Austrian urban theorist, than from the genius of the generations of local builders who contributed to organically create this iconic Indian city. Another egregious example, is the work carried out on the grand processional avenue of Chandni Chowk, where public toilets, electric transformers and security booths are being located on its central verge, again because 'there is no alternative'. The desecration of the cultural heritage of both cities are the result of the banality of routine.

Complicit in destroying Central Vista

In this light, the revamping of the Central Vista displays a similar contempt for the need to adhere to the protocols for conserving heritage and the environment. Ingenuously, the project proponents claim that they will conduct a heritage and environmental study after the design is finalised.

The latest in the unfolding drama of professional complicity is the hastily conducted exercise by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to change the land use of the project area and thus provide an ex post facto legal mantle to revamp the Central Vista.

Public notice invited stakeholders to file their objections to the proposal and several hundred cogent, credible and convincing objections were filed. These were duly 'heard' at a public meeting but deliberated in camera. To no one's surprise, the DDA announced its approval to the change of land use in the project area in 'public interest'. No other rationale has been offered. This was challenged in the Delhi High Court, which issued a stay on further proceedings, pending the response of DDA to the objections filed by the petitioners. This stay was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court by the Modi government, and the Supreme Court was will now listen to the cases on 18 March.

Not many urban development projects have attracted the attention of both civil society and professionals to examine the promises that these projects make to contribute to the welfare of society. But the Central Vista project has also revealed an aspect of our society's engagement with modernity that is seldom discussed in the public domain "" how we deal with the future of our historic cities. It has thrown into sharp relief the Modi government's obdurate pursuit of its political agenda to impose a new identity on this remarkable urban heritage, and the banality of routine makes the professional urban planner, architect and administrator very much complicit in that process. My Columbia University professor Abrams alerted me to this propensity a long time ago, but today we have the opportunity to discuss it in the public domain.

A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and Krishna Murari dismissed the plea filed by the petitioner.

The court turned down the petitioner's submission that the lions in the new emblem are aggressive and remarked, That impression depends on the mind of the person"".

The court said that it cannot be said that the emblem installed was contrary to or violates provisions of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.

The petitioner submitted that there is no scope for artistic innovation for a state emblem and had sought appropriate direction from the Centre to correct the State Emblem of India, recently installed at the top of the Central Vista Project.

The plea moved by two advocates Aldanish Rein and Ramesh Kumar Mishra stated, The State Emblem of India Act does not envisage provision in case of violation of the emblem by the State or government itself.""

Hence, the petitioner has prayed to issue appropriate direction to the respondent to correct the State Emblem of India, recently installed at the top of the Central Vista Project in New Delhi which is going to house the Parliament House and Central Secretariat of the Union of India in accordance with the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.

The Petitioners stated that They are aggrieved of the visible change made in the description and design of the State Emblem of India, recently installed at the top of the Central Vista Project at New Delhi, which is going to house the Parliament House and Central Secretariat of the Union of India.""

The Petitioner submitted that The state emblem installed at the top of the Central Vista, which was recently inaugurated by Prime Minister of India and Honourable Speaker of Lok Sabha, violates the description and design of State emblem provided under the Schedule [under section 2(b)] of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.""

The schedule of the State Emblem Act defines Emblem as Emblem means the State Emblem of India as described and specified in the Schedule to be used as the official seal of the government"".

The Schedule of the Act states that the State Emblem of India is an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capitol of Asoka, which is preserved in the Sarnath Museum.

The petitioner submitted that the newly installed State emblem of India at the top of the Central Vista project has a visible difference in the design of lions which depicts a changed composure of the lions than that of the symbol preserved in the Sarnath museum.

The plea further submitted that The lions of the newly installed emblem appear to be ferocious and aggressive with their mouth open and canine visible, while the lions of the State emblem preserved in the Sarnath museum, which has been used as an official seal so far in all respects, are calm and composed.""

The Sarnath Lion Capitol of Asoka was adopted as the State emblem of India due to its philosophical and spiritual meaning. The four lions are also representative of the four core spiritual philosophies of Buddha since Buddha himself is symbolized as a lion. The three lions visible on the capital's representation in the National Emblem signify Strength, Courage and Confidence. It also signifies constant vigilance over all four directions.

The inauguration of Central Vista has been anticipated for long and hence a huge crowd is expected to garner at the spot, post-inauguration. So we have started making the arrangements accordingly. People will be able to roam easily around the Rajpath area.

They will also be able to purchase food items from the official vendors. We have also made arrangements for washrooms"".

Two areas have been allocated for parking spaces having the capacity of around 500 and 300 cars respectively. But, as huge crowds are expected to turn at the event, we would suggest people to not bring their private vehicles and use DMRC buses and other public transport,"" the DCP said.

the DCP also requested people to use the parking spaces of the metro stations.

Out of the six, four parking, lots will be open at Kartavya path and the other two at a nearby location. Also, due to a large number of pedestrians in the place, buses will be diverted at the route from 6 pm to 9 pm, he added.

The proposed Vice-President Enclave will come up next to the North Block and the Rashtrapati Bhavan, for which the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has estimated a cost of around Rs 214 crore.

According to a notification issued on Jan 14, there are 717 trees at the project site, of which 321 will be retained and 396 transplanted.

While 135 trees will be transplanted within the project site, the CPWD has been asked to transplant 261 trees at the NTPC Eco Park in Badarpur with their own funds.

In exercise of the powers conferred by section 29 of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, hereby, in public interest exempts an area of 6.63 ha. approx. for development/redevelopment of Vice-President Enclave,"" the notification read. The CPWD has also been asked to plant 3,960 saplings of Neem, Amaltas, Peepal, Pilkhan, Gular, Bargad, Arjun and other native tree species at the NTPC Eco Park as compensatory plantation and deposit an amount of Rs 2.25 crore for the maintenance of the saplings for a period of seven years.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, a new office and a residence for the prime minister, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

According to the CPWD, Central Vista houses only 22 of the 51 ministries of the Centre. In some cases, a ministry has offices split between different buildings. This scattering of ministry offices across Delhi hampers the efficiency of administration and increases operational costs and energy usage.

The consolidated common central secretariat will have modern offices and facilities for all the 51 ministries. PTI GVS RC

The apex court made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

The top court was hearing a plea against the Delhi High Court order which said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project of the central government.

Any change at the ground level will be at their own risk,"" said a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on Jul 7, allowed the petitioner to amend his plea to challenge the recent decisions taken by the authority for the project.

The plea has been moved by two advocates Aldanish Rein and Ramesh Kumar Mishra, which stated the State Emblem of India Act does not envisage provision in case of violation of the emblem by the state or government itself.

Hence the petitioner prayed to issue appropriate direction to the respondent to correct the State Emblem of India, recently installed at the top of the Central Vista Project at New Delhi which is going to house the Parliament House and Central Secretariat of the Union of India in accordance with the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.

The Petitioners stated that they are aggrieved of the visible change made in the description and design of the State Emblem of India, recently installed at the top of the Central Vista Project at New Delhi, which is going to house the Parliament House and Central Secretariat of the Union of India.

The Petitioner submitted that the state emblem installed at the "" top of the Central Vista, which was recently inaugurated by Prime Minister of India and Hon'ble Speaker of Lok-Sabha, violates the description and design of State emblem provided under the Schedule [under section 2(b)] of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005 [hereinafter referred as 'State Emblem Act'].

The schedule of the State Emblem Act defines Emblem as Emblem means the State Emblem of India as described and specified in the Schedule to be used as official seal of the government"". The Schedule of the Act states that the State Emblem of India is an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka, which is preserved in the Sarnath Museum.

The petitioner submitted that the newly installed State emblem of India at the top of Central Vista project has a visible difference in the design of lions which depicts a changed composure of the lions than that of the symbol preserved in the Sarnath museum. The lions of the newly installed emblem appear to be ferocious and aggressive with their mouth open and canine visible, while the lions of the State emblem preserved in the Sarnath museum, which has been used as official seal so far in all respects, are calm and composed,"" the plea stated.

The plea further submitted that the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka was adopted as the State emblem of India due to its philosophical and spiritual meaning. The four lions are also representative of the four core spiritual philosophies of Buddha since Buddha himself is symbolized as a lion. The three lions visible on the capital's representation in the National Emblem signify Strength, Courage and Confidence. It also signifies constant vigilance over all four directions. Thus, the State emblem of India is not just a graphic design but also have entrenched cultural and philosophical significance, state the plea. (ANI)

While considering that this will be a very successful project, I am sure, some state governments will draw inspiration and take steps necessary to recommend and integrate all government buildings, different state departments and other subsidiary offices, rather than being scattered all over the state capital,"" Puri said.

He was replying to a question by AIADMK MP A. Vijayakumar on whether there is any proposal to construct an integrated government office complex as an extension of the Central Vista project in other states.

Puri said states might wish to consider it, but at this stage, that is hypothetical"".

Also, given the federal structure of our Constitution, surely, this recommendation would have to come from the state governments. But it is an inspirational question. All I can say for the record and with a sense of responsibility that so far no demand has come from any state government on this specific suggestion.""

The Central Vista Redevelopment project comprises building a new Parliament along with an integrated Central Secretariat, comprising offices of all central ministries. The ten office buildings will come up in four plots along the Central Vista, where currently different ministries are located. The old structures will be demolished to make way for the new buildings.

Not a single historical building, not a single iconic building, which is part of our history, culture will be removed,"" Puri said, adding that only buildings like Krishi Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, which have become substandard, will be demolished.

Why are you getting so excited? Let me tell you Madam, that if buildings like Krishi Bhawan, buildings like Shastri Bhawan, buildings like Nirman Bhawan have to come down, will you be sorry because you built those buildings and they were substandard buildings and they are not fit for a capital city?""

 You built those buildings. We are going to now relocate you into a new Parliament building, where you will have enough place to sit,"" he said.

Puri further said that all offices will be located together and the Central Vista Secretariat will have space for 50,000 people. It will be connected through an underground shuttle tunnel so that transportation becomes very easy.

New Parliament will be ready to hold 2022 winter session

Puri informed the House that construction of the new Parliament building is in progress and it will be ready by 2022, in time to hold the winter session and mark the 75th year of independence.

Once the new Parliament building is ready, the existing Parliament building will have to be repaired and made available for alternate uses"", the minister said.

Puri said that at this point of time, no comprehensive thought has been given as to what precise use the old Parliament building would be put to.

Several suggestions keep coming, including that there should be an institute of democratic or parliamentary style. These are merely suggestions. No decisions have been taken,"" the minister said.

Puri said the Central Vista Project is an ambitious and long overdue project.

It was hinted at when late Shri Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister and also when Shrimati Meira Kumar was the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha,"" he added.

The IGNCA, established in the memory of former prime minister Indira Gandhi, may be shifted near Jamnagar House, where around 15 acre land currently being used by hutments are likely to be removed.

According to the proposed plan, the IGNCA building and other nine buildings including Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shashtri Bhawan, vice president residence and are likely to be demolished to pave the way for the construction of a common Central Secretariat to house various ministries.

The IGNCA is currently located on the Man Singh Road.

The plan to shift the IGNCA, however, is yet to be finalised by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, which is the nodal ministry for the mega project, the sources said.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath "" from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate.

The sources said that all cultural institutions will be relocated near Jamnagar House, adding that government has also planned to set up a state of the art National Centre for Performing Arts there.

The common Central Secretariat will comprise eight buildings, four on each side of Central Vista. Each building will have eight floors, which will house various ministries.

There are currently around 25,000 to 32,000 employees working in various ministries situated in different locations in the Lutyens' Delhi. The common Central Secretariat will accommodate more employees at one place.

According to an estimate, the government is currently paying Rs 1,000 crore as rent annually for its offices spread across the national capital.

Under the project, several subways will be constructed to ensure movement of pedestrians around common Central Secretariat, which will also be connected through Yellow and Violet line of the Delhi Metro.

There will be transit oriented development under the Central Vista project,"" the sources said.

The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has estimated that redevelopment of Central Vista will cost around Rs 12,879 crore.

The apex court was hearing the appeal against the May 4 order of the high court which had listed the PIL for hearing on May 17 saying it wants to first go through what the Supreme Court has deliberated in its judgement of Jan 5, giving a go ahead to the ambitious project.

The apex court today asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra to mention the matter before the High Court for urgent listing on May 10.

We are of the opinion that since the matter is pending before the High Court and the order challenged in the special leave petition is only of adjournment, we are not inclined to go into the merit of the case, a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshari said.

It said that in given circumstances, we request Mr. Luthra to file the petition himself or through any other counsel, to make a request before Delhi High Court on Monday (May 10) to take up the matter as early as possible .

It noted the submission of the senior advocate that the matter involves extreme urgency and said that the High Court may consider the prayer and pass orders.

At the outset, Luthra told the bench that the matter is of extreme importance as the country is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

He said they are only concerned with the challenge to the permission granted for continuation of construction which is going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.

Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Raj Path and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them, Luthra said.

He referred to the letter written by Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for continuation of construction work in Central Vista project on the ground that it is time bound work.

The permission was granted on the ground that it was essential activity. How is construction work an essential activity? In a health emergency, we cannot risk the lives of workers and their families and put more pressure on health care system, Luthra said adding that peak of second wave of COVID-19 is being anticipated by May 15 and High Court has listed the matter for May 17, which would not serve any purpose.

He said that when the nation is considering lockdown and even Indian Premier League is being shut, the construction activity cannot be allowed.

Justice Saran said, When we are sitting in closed rooms with face masks, itself shows the situation is grim. We would not like to make any further comments on the COVID situation as other benches are seized of the matter, otherwise our remarks may be misinterpreted .

The top court disposed of the plea.

The High Court has deferred the hearing on a PIL which had sought direction to Centre to halt construction work at the Central project due to prevailing COVID situation.

Petitioners Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, have claimed that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.

They have said before the High Court that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, has said.

The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

These former bureaucrats, many of whom are from foreign affairs ministry, have said in their letter that if reports are to be believed, the new Parliament building is being constructed because of superstitious belief that the old building is unlucky, yeh padhe likhe murkh hi nahin hain, they are a disgrace (they are not only educated fools, they are a disgrace),"" Puri said at a press conference.

Puri said that so many letters are floating on social media that somehow he had missed this letter written by the former bureaucrats.

Some of my officers brought to my notice today when I was preparing for the press conference. The open letter was floating in the social media but it never came to me,"" Puri said.

The minister said that a false narrative is being created about the Central Vista project and people have on their own put a figure of Rs 20,000 crore to the project and are linking its construction with the pandemic.

What is its relationship with the pandemic? From where has this Rs 20,000 crore figure come up? The total cost of the projects currently under construction "" the Parliament building and the Central Vista Avenue "" is around Rs 1,300-odd crores. The Parliament building will cost approximately Rs 862 crore and the Central Vista Avenue Rs 477 crore,"" Puri said.

The minister said that the Centre has allocated Rs 35,000 crore for the Covid vaccination programme in the country. If required, more will be allocated. There is enough money,"" he said.

The Central Vista revamp plan, aimed at giving Delhi's power corridor a complete makeover, will include the construction of a new triangular-shaped Parliament, a new Prime Minister's residence, and 10 new building blocks to accommodate government offices, including Shastri Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan and Vayu Bhavan, among others. These buildings currently house the offices of different central ministries such as education, health, housing, agriculture, commerce, air force, among others.

Puri clarified that so far no design has been cleared for a new Prime Minister's residence. Construction in only two projects are underway currently "" the new Parliament building and the Central Vista avenue. We are working on these two projects on a priority basis because we want them to be ready in time for India's 75th (Independence) anniversary in 2022,"" Puri said.

Reacting to critics, the minister asserted that work on the project will not stop.

Not only that, one of my political colleagues, Jairam Ramesh had penned an article in The Hindu newspaper in 2012 where he said that we badly need a new Parliament Building. This one is simply not functional and outdated Now he is creating a false narrative,"" said Puri.

The Central Vista project has come under attack from opposition parties and civic society, who have called for stopping it at a time when the Covid pandemic is raging in the country. They have said that the project will not only be detrimental for the city environmentally, but will also destroy some of the most historic buildings dotting Lutyens' Delhi.

Puri, however, said Monday that none of the historic, cultural and iconic buildings will be touched in Central Vista including the North and South Block. They will remain exactly the same,"" he said.

Calling the protests against the new Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue motivated, Puri said that a new Parliament building is required because the present one has run out of space and is structurally not safe.

When we sit we are cramped in, there is no space. The building was not made to accommodate so many people In 2026, because of delimitation, the number of members will increase. The freeze on current numbers will be lifted in 2026. Then what will you do? Will we do bunk seating inside Parliament?"" Puri said.

The minister said that it's not a vanity"" project but a necessary"" project.

The Delhi High Court Monday also dismissed a petition challenging the Central Vista project, calling it motivated"".

Puri also asserted that the ongoing construction work will not stop. What do you want? There was a challenge in front of us. During the first wave we braved it with great courage. Now in the second wave, should we stop work? The construction workers who are working there, should they stop work? Conventional wisdom says you spend your way out of the crisis. You increase economic activity. These are time bound contracts. Do you think the contractors will continue paying the workers if work stops?""

The minister added that the government is taking all the necessary measures needed to ensure that the workers on site are safe and healthy.

Selfie takers had a field day on the rechristened Kartavya Path  from the Raisina Hill complex to India Gate  which was thrown open to the public on Friday after two years. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

Most of the visitors, especially the youngsters, were busy choosing their favourite spots near the lawns and the newly built bridges on the water bodies looking to get the perfect snap of themselves.

It's a great place for selfies I must have clicked over a dozen selfies here,"" said a civil service aspirant visiting Central Vista Avenue along with his friends.

As evening descended, the number of visitors surged. People took a stroll along the entire stretch and halted at the India Gate complex for more photos and selfies at the memorial.

We have been to this place dozens of times. Earlier it lacked the grandeur. I hope this will be maintained and people will also keep it clean and avoid littering,"" said Rakesh Awasthi who was visiting the place with his family.

However, some visitors missed the boating facility in the water bodies along the lawns.

I do not see any boats now. Hope they will be here soon since children like them very much,"" said a security guard near one of the water bodies where a ticket kiosk existed earlier.

Officials said there is a plan to allow boating at two water bodies  one close to Krishi Bhawan and the other near the upcoming Vanijya Bhawan.

The water bodies are a part of the landscape of the avenue. Under the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project, the water bodies have been rebuilt with reinforced edges while redstone pavements have been built along it. Aerators and dissolved air flotation systems have been fitted to keep the water clean.

Another big draw at the spot was cultural performances by artistes from all over the country.

A large number of people gathered at a stage set up near India Gate, keenly watching Naurta and Kalbelia folk dances and lauding each performance.

After inaugurating Kartavya Path, Modi urged people to visit it and take selfies with it and upload them on social media. New signages bearing the new nomenclature of the ceremonial boulevard have been put up on the streetsides.

New MP chambers are part of the Centre's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, and these will be built by demolishing the Transport Bhawan and Shram Shakti Bhawan here.

The project also envisages a plan to build a tunnel that will connect the MP chambers with the new Parliament building.

According to an official document, the CPWD on Monday issued a notice seeking quotations from interested agencies to conduct the subsurface survey to look for underground utilities at the two buildings that currently house the offices of tourism, skill development and entrepreneurship, ports, shipping and waterways, and road transport and highways ministries, among others.

The estimated cost of the survey is Rs 7.60 lakh, according to the document.

Kartavya Path, earlier known as Rajpath, has been revamped. Construction of the new Parliament building, the common Central Secretariat and Vice President's Enclave are underway.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and made various suggestions for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending the Central Vista beautification and construction project forthwith.

At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained, Gandhi said.

This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping frontline workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and better facilities, she said in her letter.

Several opposition leaders have been criticising the government's move of going ahead with the project and the issue was back in focus on Monday with the Centre's decision to suspend Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) Funds for two years.

Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel and party MP Karti Chidambaram on Monday slammed the government over the Central Vista project amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

While Patel said the central government can save more than Rs 20,000 crore by scrapping the Central Vista redevelopment project, Chidambaram said the BJP's vanity projects should be shut.

CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury has also been a vehement critic of the Central Vista project and responding to the suspension of MPLADS funds, he tweeted, If there's no money with the government, why doesn't it abandon the Central Vista project in Delhi? Does it deserve a higher priority than lives of lakhs of Indians?

Yechury had also criticised the Centre's timing on issuing the land use change notification for the project last month, saying, Modi government's priorities are cruel. When all resources must be mopped up to meet this COVID-19 challenge a Gazette notification is issued for the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project. Shame.

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra also slammed the government over the project, saying the government is suspending MPLADS funds for two years for resources to fight COVID-19, but the BJP spends Rs 20,000 crore on the Central Vista project, Rs 27,000 crore in the past Lok Sabha election and Rs 2,500 crore on one statue.

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has also hit out at the government over the project saying the Rs 20,000 crore earmarked for it must be diverted to supplement the allocation to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Grand spending on buildings at this time of crisis is a postponable luxury , he had said recently.

Economic costs of COVID-19 are expected to be very high.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month announced a slew of relief measures for taxpayers and businesses. She also announced a Rs 1.7-lakh-crore relief package for those hit hardest.

The Centre last month approved the land use change for execution of its ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project in Lutyens' Delhi with the issuance of a notification by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista "" the nation's power corridor "" envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath "" from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

The new Parliament House building will come up on a 9.5-acre land near the existing building. Earlier, the plot was meant for development of a district park.

According to sources, the prime minister's residence and office are likely to be shifted near the South Block and vice-president's new house will be in the vicinity of the North Block.

The vice president's current residence is among those buildings identified by the government for demolition in Lutyens' Delhi for the purpose of the project.

According to an affidavit submitted by the CPWD, which is attached to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, there is a shortfall of about 0.38 million square metres in office space and as a result, the government spends around Rs 1,000 crore every year as office rent.

The top court was hearing two public interest litigations (PIL) filed by Rajeev Suri and Lt Col (retd) Anuj Srivastava against the Central Vista redevelopment project. Questions have been raised over the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new Parliament House.

The project proposes a new modern Parliament House that can accommodate 1,224 members of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha "" in case of a joint session. Besides, there will be 10 administrative buildings for all ministries, conversion of North and South blocks into museums and development of the Central Vista avenue that connects Rajpath to India Gate.

Parliament building unsafe, evacuation not possible: CPWD

Originally developed to house the legislative council, the existing Parliament House is showing signs of distress, the affidavit said.

Furthermore, the affidavit added, the building does not satisfy the upgraded safety measures for an earthquake-proof building, is not designed according to the fire norms, is not energy efficient, and has ineffective acoustics.

The electrical, air-conditioning and plumbing systems are also inadequate, inefficient and costly to maintain and operate. The present arrangement to add more seats in Central Hall during a joint session leaves the place cramped and poses challenges for evacuation in case of an emergency situation, the CPWD submitted.

A green area of 9.5 acres adjacent to the existing structure has been designated to build the new Parliament complex.

Moreover, it said, the present building is not spacious to add more seats in case the strength of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha increased.

According to the affidavit, the seats are likely to increase substantially after 2026 as the freeze on total number of seats is only until then. The current strength of 545 Lok Sabha seats was due to the delimitation exercise carried out on the basis of the 1971 census.

The new Lok Sabha chamber will accommodate 876 members and 1,224 members during a joint session. Similarly, the proposed Rajya Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity of 400 members.

CPWD assured the SC that there will be no loss of green space due to the new Parliament House. According to the proposal, green spaces will be provided in three different pockets in the Central Vista area.

Office buildings to be interconnected via underground shuttle

The Cabinet Secretariat is spread over 47 buildings and houses various ministries. While, 39 are located in the current Central Vista, 12 are spread outside this area.

After the redevelopment, all 51 ministries will be situated in the 10 buildings on the Central Vista area.

A 3-km-long underground shuttle has also been proposed to connect and integrate the new buildings. According to the plan, this will run in a closed loop to meet the transport requirement of government employees and will also connect to the existing metro stations at Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat, a move aimed to discourage official staff from using private vehicles.

The affidavit sought to dispel the belief that undue haste has been shown in giving clearances to the project. It said the Central Vista Committee members held an online meeting on 23 Apr, rejecting certain representations to defer it because it felt that an important project such as this one cannot be postponed for an indefinite period.

Works of government cannot be held up indefinitely and project times lines have to be adhered to keep the envisaged cost of project in check"" the affidavit stated.

Today, in the 75th year of Independence, we are taking another step towards developing the capital of our country according to the needs and aspirations of the new India,"" Modi said.

These new defence office complexes are going to further strengthen our efforts to make the working of our forces more convenient and effective,"" Modi said.

The prime ministers said the modern offices will go a long way in effectively carrying out all the work related to the security of the nation by the three forces.

This is a big step towards the creation of a modern defence enclave in the capital,"" he said.

The officers and other staffers of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces are moving into the new office complexes from their existing workplaces in pre-Independence era hutments in and around the Raisina Hills.

In his address, Modi criticised those who were opposed to the Central Vista project saying they never bothered to find out how the armed forces personnel were working in those hutments.

When we talk about the capital, it is not just a city. The capital of any country is a symbol of the thinking, determination, strength and culture of that country,"" Modi said.

India is the mother of democracy. Therefore, the capital of India should be such that its central focus should be people,"" he said.

The two buildings, constructed by the Housing and Urban Affairs with resources allocated by the Defence Ministry, have an office space of 9.60 lakhs sq feet.

Today, when we are focusing on ease of living and ease of doing business, modern infrastructure plays an equally important role in this. This is the spirit at the core of the work being done today related to Central Vista,"" the prime minister said.

Modi also said that he was confident that work on the new Parliament building will be completed on time.

The move comes after the area's civic body recently issued a notice approving the renaming of the historic road at its special meeting on Sep 7.

Signages around the India Gate hexagon are mounted on stainless steel-made unipoles with horizontal plates bearing white text on green background.

Late Friday night, one of the signages with three green plates bore name of two streets "" Sher Shah Suri Marg and Dr Zakir Hussain Marg "" while 'Rajpath' inscribed earlier in the top plate could be seen scraped off, as also from other signages that bore the old name.

On Sunday, another signage was seen with 'Rajpath' erased from the middle plate, flanked by 'Akbar Road' plate above and 'Ashoka Road' plate below it.

Sources in the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) said the erasure of 'Rajpath' from signages were being taken up by authorities working on the redevelopment project after the official nod to the rechristening. It will be replaced with 'Kartavya Path'.

New, big signages bearing the new nomenclature of the ceremonial boulevard have been put up on the streetsides. Many youths were seen taking selfies with new signages bearing 'Kartavya Path' on a wide shining green board erected on the erstwhile Rajpath.

These new green boards bearing 'Kartavya Path' (in four languages) on the old Rajpath have been installed by Central Vista project authorities in line with a theme,"" an official said.

Similar thematic signages bearing 'C-Hexagon' have also been installed around its periphery.

Rajpath was known as Kingsway during the British rule, while Janpath was known as Queensway. Both historic streets were renamed soon after Independence.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi, who is also a member of the NDMC, had on Sep 7 said: However, after 75 years of Independence, it is felt that the name of Rajpath needs to be changed, in tune with the values and principles of democracy and a contemporary, new India. The Kartavya Path will also inspire everyone who visit or cross the road to perform their duties towards the country, the society and their families,"" she said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the 'Kartavya Path' on Sep 8 and it was thrown open to the public from Sep 9. He had urged people to take selfies with it and upload it on social media.

In his address after the inauguration, he said Kingsway or Rajpath, a symbol of slavery"", has now been consigned to history and has been erased forever.

The ceremonial boulevard of the national capital running from the Raisina Hill complex to India Gate began its journey as Kingsway, a majestic central axis in the heart of New Delhi that was built here after the imperial seat of the administration was shifted from Calcutta (now Kolkata) as announced by British monarch King George V in 1911.

The historic street in India's power capital has been a silent witness to India's transition from a colony under the British rule to a vibrant Republic.

It has seen the dawn of Independence and played host to annual Republic Day celebrations for over seven decades, starting 1951.

Only the first Republic Day celebrations was held at Irwin Amphitheatre (now Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium) behind India Gate complex, where the Rajpath stretch ends. PTI KND CK

The Central Vista revamp, announced in Sep 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

The apex court was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave the undertaking before a bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar that held an urgent suo motu hearing Monday morning.

The bench expressed displeasure at the government for aggressively"" going ahead with the construction work of the Central Vista project, indirectly referring to news reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was going to lay the foundation stone for the new Parliament building on 10 Dec.

We thought we are dealing with a prudent litigation and deference will be shown,"" the bench said, adding it never thought the government will go ahead aggressively with construction"".

We have shown deference to you and expected that you will act in a prudent manner. The same deference should be shown to the court and there should be no demolition or construction,"" the judges told Mehta, who sought a day's time to revert.

However, the court gave him only five minutes to seek his instructions. On his return, Mehta stated there will be no construction, demolition or felling of trees.

Foundation stone will be laid but no physical changes,"" Mehta assured the bench, which then allowed the government to proceed with the project's paperwork.

The Delhi State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) had last week recommended the SEIAA to give green nod to the project.

The SEIAA discussed the project at a meeting on Wednesday and approved it.

The Forest Department had on Aug 23 granted permission to the Central Public Works Department, the user agency, to transplant 487 of the 807 trees at the site under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.

CPWD officials said the proposal had been submitted for environmental clearance in Dec last year.

The SEAC, which vets the proposals before they are sent to SEIAA for clearance, had earlier this month set up a sub-committee to examine the implementation of the Delhi government's policy for tree transplantation and review the site plan in order to retain trees."" Under the policy notified by the government in Dec 2020, agencies concerned are required to transplant a minimum of 80 per cent of the trees affected by their development works.

The benchmark tree survival rate at the end of one year of tree transplantation is 80 per cent.

The sub-committee in its report said the tree survey was not carried out at the time of project feasibility assessment and site identification.

The SEAC, which first examined the proposal in a meeting on Jan 31, had raised concern over the CPWD's plan to remove an excessively high proportion"" of trees from the site.

The CPWD later revised the proposal, decreasing the number of trees to be transplanted from 630 to 487 and increasing the number of trees to be retained at the site from 154 to 320.

In a meeting held on Apr 9, the SEAC decided to recommend the revised proposal to the SEIAA for grant of environmental clearance.

The SEIAA, however, referred the matter back to the SEAC to ensure provisions of the tree transplantation policy are complied with.

According to the revised proposal for the Rs 1,381-crore project, the CPWD will maintain 1,022 trees at the site, so as to have a tree per 80 square metre of plot area as per the guidelines of the Union environment ministry.

A total of five buildings with a built-up area of 90,000 square metres will be constructed at the site after demolishing the built-up area of 47,000 sqm.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new parliament building, common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new office and residence for the prime minister, and a new vice president enclave.

The proposals were made by the DFS after the building designs were presented for approval and it had to fight resistance from the architects who said the changes will hamper the beauty of these buildings, they said.

The proposals include an internal road for fire tenders movement in case of high rise buildings and provisions for a fire check road for the protection of exits and staircases.

Pressurisation"" of the staircase and means of escape is another recommendation suggested wherever required in the building designs, they said.

Each of the seven proposals consist of plans for more than two buildings which were cleared between 2020-2022, they said.

These buildings are "" New Parliament Building, New PMO building, Rajpath, Amenity block, and Common Central secretariat being made under the Central Vista project, and a few other office buildings.

Other than these, various in-built fire-fighting arrangements are recommended to be installed in the buildings such as a fire exit, a hose reel, a wet riser, hydrants, an automatic sprinkler system, internal hydrants and yard hydrants, pumping arrangements, and captive water storage for fire-fighting, the fire officers said.

Automatic fire detection and alarming system, manual-operated electric fire alarm system and a public address system are also recommended as per National Building Code of India Chapter 4 on fire and fire safety.

All the recommendations suggested are being followed and implemented in the building designs which had altered,"" the officer said.

Atul Garg, Director of DFS said, The buildings under the Central Vista project have state-of-the-art technology as far as the fire department is considered. We have tried to provide the best infrastructure for the fire safety system. This is going to have in-built fire safety systems with a set up of a huge fire control room as well."" The fire officials said that initially it was not easy to convince the architects of the project to make certain specific changes in terms of fire safety system as they were of the view that any such changes could affect the beauty of the buildings.

However, after a lot of discussions and at least seven-eight rounds of meetings held with our retired service providers, architects and consultants involved in the project, they agreed to make all the necessary suggestions recommended by the fire department to ensure an efficient fire safety system,"" the director told PTI.

He said the fire safety system provided in each of these buildings is one of the best of its kind."" As it is a very important project, the fire department has suggested more fire fighting systems. All due precautions have been taken with reference to the fire safety system of the buildings and it will be a model building as far as the fire system is considered even though there was stiff resistance earlier."" Dr Sanjay Kumar Tomar, Deputy Chief Fire Officer said, the major recommendations suggested for each of these buildings include a fire safety arrangement, means of escape, and means of accessing and exiting the building with such considerations as the number, width, type and arrangement of sufficient number of exits.

Fire compartmentation, protection of exits through fire check doors, fire resistant material for construction of buildings as per unified by laws 2016 were also made to be incorporated in the design of the buildings, he said.

Several meetings with the architects and designers were held and they were convinced and agreed to make the changes and submitted the revised building plans which were approved by Delhi Fire Service,"" Tomar said.

The officer said that It is usually a routine process that before giving approval to buildings, parameters with respect to fire and life safety measures are scrutinised and deficiencies, shortcomings are conveyed so that those shortcomings can be removed."" Nowadays, all building plans are referred to Delhi Fire Service through the online portals of respective building sanctioning authorities such as Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Central Public Works Department, Public Work Department etc, he added.

According to the fire department, these building plans are either approved, and shortcomings if there are any are communicated online within 15 days of receipt of building plans.

In important projects of the government with fixed timeline, prior meetings are conducted to discuss fire safety measures according to their nature, such as if they are residential, educational, institutional (hospitals), business, mercantile, industrial, or are going to be used to store hazardous material.

Most of the buildings under the Central Vista project are divided into fire sub-compartments having fire resistant walls on all sides including top and bottom, which will help them contain fire within its origin, the fire officials said.

All openings (service ducts) in a fire compartment are sealed through fire resistant material. All exits are provided with fire check doors in a sub fire compartment, they said.

The buildings also have a smoke management system "" a very important provision to control smoke in case of fire, the fire officials said.

The buildings provide safe passage for the occupants and also facilitate fire-fighters to locate the origin of fire. This helps in controlling fire early leading to less damage.

The fire smoke contains harmful gases like hydrogen snide, carbon monoxide and HCL. These affect in three ways They are harmful poisonous gases, chemical irritants which impede escape by obscuring life,"" he added. PTI AMP AMP VN VN

The redevelopment will also include a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, to be completed by 2022, in time for the 75th anniversary of Independence, sources familiar with the developments told ThePrint. The other projects are to be completed by 2024.

The new PM residence will move to the southern side of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Rajiv Gandhi had made 7, Race Course Road (now Lok Kalyan Marg) his home as PM in 1984, but it was only in May 1990 that the urban development ministry declared the premises as the permanent residence-cum-office of the Prime Minister of India.

New Parliament

The new Parliament building will be triangular in shape, and is to be located opposite the existing one in the same premises. The old Parliament House, an iconic structure designed by renowned British architect Herbert Baker in 1931, will not be touched.

The new building will have a Lok Sabha with a capacity to seat 900-1,000 people, a Rajya Sabha and a common lounge in place of the current Parliament's Central Hall.

Other heritage buildings such as the North and South Block will also not be touched. Both will be converted into museums "" one showcasing India before 1857, and the other after 1857.

The demolished buildings will give way to 10 new eight-storeyed government buildings along Rajpath, part of a common central secretariat will house approximately one lakh government employees. The current government buildings at the Central Vista house approximately 35,000 employees.

The demolition will happen in a phased manner to avoid major disruption,"" said a housing ministry official.

The outer facade of all the new buildings will remain more or less like the existing ones, in sync with the surrounding aesthetics. However, inside, the structures will be mostly steel and glass, and will be equipped with the latest gadgets and modern facilities. All the buildings will also have an atrium with trees planted in the middle.

All the eight blocks will be shorter in height than India Gate. The canal alongside Rajpath as well as the gardens will not be tinkered with.

The idea is to move government offices that are located across the city to one place. This will not only save time in commuting from one office to another but also resources,"" the official added.

The government currently shells out Rs 1,000 crore on rent every year.

All the new offices are to be connected by an underground metro rail. There will be a shuttle service between all the offices. We are in talks with DMRC to work out the details,"" said a second housing ministry official.

Also in the plans are a walkway and a cycling path connecting India Gate to the Yamuna. Shuttle buses will also be available on the route.

The Union Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned dreams into reality with the Central Vista Project.

PM Modi has fulfilled the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and even Jawaharlal Nehru for that matter, which the Congress could not accomplish during their tenure"", said Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

He continued by saying that Central-Vista Avenue is something in which all Indians take tremendous pride and that the Congress party continues to have issues.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 'Kartavya Path' at India Gate on Thursday. He said 'Kartavya Path' symbolises a shift from erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power, to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment. He also unveiled the statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate occasion.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that in the time of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav the nation felt a new inspiration and energy today.

Today, we are filling the picture of tomorrow with new colours, leaving behind the past. Today this new aura is visible everywhere, it is the aura of confidence of New India"", he said.

The Prime Minister emphasized that the Kartavya Path is not just a road of bricks and stones but a living example of India's democratic past and all-time ideals. The Prime Minister highlighted that on the contrary, the Rajpath was for the British Raj who considered the people of India as slaves.

He stressed that the emotion and structure of the Rajpath were a symbol of slavery, but today with the change in architecture, its spirit is also transformed. This Kartavya Path stretching from the National War Memorial to Rashtrapati Bhawan will be vibrant with a sense of duty, he added.

The Prime Minister said that India of today is working on cultural infrastructure along with physical, digital, and transport infrastructure. For Social infrastructure, he gave examples of new AIIMS and medical colleges, IITs, water connections, and Amrit Sarovar.

He said rural roads and the record number of modern expressways, railways and metro networks, and new airports are expanding transport infrastructure in an unprecedented manner. Optical fiber to panchayats and records of digital payments have made India's digital infrastructure a topic of global appreciation.

Talking about cultural infrastructure, PM Modi said that it does not mean just the infrastructure associated with the places of faith but also includes infrastructure related to our history, our national heroes, and our national heritage. He said that the development of such sites is also taking place with equal urgency.

Be it Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity or a museum dedicated to tribal freedom fighters, PM Museum or Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial, National War Memorial or National Police Memorial, these are examples of cultural infrastructure"", the Prime Minister said.

PM Modi stressed that an aspirational India can make rapid progress only by giving impetus to social infrastructure, transport infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and cultural infrastructure as a whole.

A Central Public Works Department official said the increased scope of work under the project, including additional information and communication technologies (ICT) components, has led to a marginal rise in the estimated cost.

The petitioners on the other hand contended they were only interested in the safety of the workers at the site and the citizens' lives and compared the project to Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II.

Hard-hitting arguments against the maintainability of the plea and the continuation of the project were made during the over three hour-long hearing before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh which reserved its judgement in the matter.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the PIL, saying it lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workforce.

Opposing the claims of the petitioners, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the plea was a facade"", a disguise"" in the form of a PIL to stall the project which they always wanted to stop.

Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government cannot see it, then it was a sorry reflection"" of their concerns for the lives of the citizens.

Referring to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather central fortress of death"" and comparing it to Auschwitz"", Luthra contended that the Centre's submissions with regard to the availability of medical facilities, testing centre, etc on site were all falsehoods.

He said that only empty tents have been set up at the place and there were no beds or bedding for workers to stay or sleep there.

Mehta was displeased with the project being referred to as Auschwitz saying one can criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court.

Luthra also contended that while the Centre claims some workers stayed back willingly to work on the project, no proof of their will has been shown.

He also said that if any facilities have been created at the site, it was for the reason that the high court agreed to hear the matter.

Countering the claims of the petitioners, the Solicitor General said one of the petitioners has been opposed to the project long before it got the go-ahead from the Supreme Court in Jan this year.

He said the petitioners were not concerned for the health and safety of workers at the other constructions going on in the city.

Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) with regard to the health of workmen,"" he added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.

Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for Shapoorji Pallonji, told the court that there was no law under which he has to place on record a worker's willingness to work.

He said the petitioners cannot decide what was the safe timeline for completing the project and the company had to finish it by Nov so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.

He further said that half of Rajpath has been dug up and if the work is stalled then when the monsoon comes, the pits there would fill up with water which could lead to a collapse of adjacent areas and also the creation of a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases.

The court was hearing the plea by Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film-maker, who have contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the petition, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.

The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) sub-committee decided to implement Stage III of GRAP in the entire NCR in a move to prevent further deterioration of air quality.

Under this, all construction work will be banned except for special projects like Central Vista and other projects of national need,"" read the official press release from Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas.

To address the deteriorating air quality of the National Capital Region, the Sub-Committee for invoking actions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the CAQM in NCR and adjoining areas held an emergency meeting.

While comprehensively reviewing the overall air quality parameters during the meeting, the Commission noted that due to unfavourable meteorological conditions with slower wind speed and sudden spike in farm fire incidents, it is considered necessary to implement Stage III of GRAP with immediate effect in the entire NCR.

As per the dynamic model and weather/ meteorological forecast, the overall air quality over Delhi is likely to remain in the Very Poor to Severe category from 29.10.2022 to 30.10.2022. The air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain in a Severe category from 31.10.2022 to 01.11.2022 and for the subsequent 6 Days, the air quality is likely to fluctuate between the Severe to Very Poor category,"" read the official statement from CAQM.

The CAQM further noted that the winds are forecasted to be CALM in the coming days and the wind direction is likely to change course frequently. Thus, there is a high likelihood of the pollutants getting trapped in the region and not getting dispersed effectively.

626,https://theprint.in/india/doughnut-shaped-buildings-underground-shuttle-how-new-central-secretariat-will-look-like/555044/,"New Delhi: Ten identical stone-clad, doughnut-shaped buildings housing all the 51 central government ministries with 51,000 employees. An underground shuttle linked to the metro, connecting all the buildings. Smart technology-driven offices surrounded by greenery, a modern conference centre and landscaped lawns.

This is how the Central Secretariat complex will look like after one of the most ambitious urban upgrade projects of Lutyens Delhi is completed, government sources told ThePrint.

It is part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, which also includes a new Parliament building that will be ready by 2022. The first three office buildings of the Central Secretariat complex will come up in the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts stands and will be completed by 2023.

A far more complex project than the new Parliament building, both in terms of size and managing the logistics, preparatory work for the Central Secretariat revamp is under way in full swing, with HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, the project architect giving finishing touches to the design.

The Central Secretariat complex currently has offices of 22 Union ministries, housing 41,000 employees, and appears almost run down at many places.

The design of the Central Secretariat's offices will help to improve the efficiency and productivity of administration,"" Bimal Patel, head of HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited told ThePrint. They will have modern facilities and infrastructure, be energy efficient, modular and easy to maintain.""

'Doughnut-shaped building, rectangular courtyard'

The ten stone-clad buildings will come up on four plots along the Central Vista "" five on either side of the Rajpath "" where different ministries are currently located. The old structures will be demolished to make way for the new buildings. The height of all the buildings will be 42 m (ground + six floors), which will be lower than India Gate.

The exteriors of all the buildings will be identical to the other surrounding Lutyens buildings.

According to the proposed design, each of the four plots will have a cluster of three doughnut-shaped buildings, housing different offices. And there will be a rectangular courtyard with big trees in the middle. The ground floor of each of the buildings will have shared facilities like conference halls and cafes.

Besides, each of the three buildings will have an interconnected basement allowing people to go from one office to another. The offices will have open floors, which if needed in future, could be expanded

An important feature of the proposed plan is the thrust given to transit-oriented development.

According to government sources, the design being firmed up by the architectural firm proposes building an underground people mover (kind of an electric vehicle with automated carriages). It will be built in a loop below the ground level and will connect to the metro that runs perpendicularly across the Central Vista, on the lines of the interconnected airport terminals in Dubai or Singapore.

Office goers can get out of the metro, take the shuttle and reach the basement of their respective office block. From there they can take an elevator to go to their office,"" a government source said.

Being connected to the metro by an underground people mover, they will also promote the use of public transport,"" Patel said.

Besides the underground shuttle, an overground bus route will also connect all the buildings.

Modern central conference centre to replace Vigyan Bhawan

Vigyan Bhawan, the government's main convention centre, will be among the structures that will be demolished. A modern central conference centre with all the latest amenities will come up adjacent to the National Archives, one of the handful of buildings that is not being demolished.

Senior housing ministry officials, who did not want to be named, said the Central Secretariat is being designed to make it compact. The character of the area is not going to change in any way. It's just that we are making it more efficient by optimally using the space available to cater to the growing requirement,"" said a senior housing ministry official.

Currently, in the Central Secretariat there are only 22 ministries with 41,000 employees. The remaining 29 ministries where another 10,000 employees work are located across the city,"" the official added. Many of them are running from rented properties. This is draining the exchequer. The revamp will help create more space to accommodate all the 51 ministries.""

The Central Vista revamp, announced in Sep 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by Aug, 2022 when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

The apex court was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.

The matter came up for hearing before a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar which asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Centre, to file a short affidavit on the issue.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the authorities have not demonstrated any public interest as far as the change in land use from recreational to residential for the plot is concerned.

Mehta told the bench that official residences for the Vice-President and the Prime Minister are stipulated on the plot.

So, the public recreation area is not available now, the bench asked Mehta, adding, Is the public recreational area going to be transposed to some other place or transferred to some other plot .

Mehta said the recreational area could be shifted but he also cited security concerns considering that Parliament would come up there.

What is your stand, we would like to know about it, the bench said.

I will have to take instructions, Mehta said, adding, Considering that Parliament and other things would be coming up nearby, from a security point of view it would not be possible to have a recreational area in the vicinity .

The bench asked whether he would like to file a short affidavit on the limited point raised in the matter.

Mehta said he would file an affidavit within three days.

The respondents (Centre and others) may file short affidavit to deal with this contention within three days from today, including to justify the necessity of modification, the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on Oct 29.

In Jan this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.

The top court's verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.

The top court had in Jun this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID pandemic.

In the last two weeks, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats gave their budgetary and administrative clearances for the Rs 922 crore project. A senior official in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs told ThePrint that the cost will be taken out of the budget heads of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

In the 2020-21 fiscal, the Lok Sabha has been allocated Rs 811.10 crore while the Rajya Sabha has been allocated Rs 436.29 crore.

The two secretariats won't be footing the entire cost of the project this fiscal. It will be spread over the next two years,"" the official said, adding that the secretariats will not be able to spend their entire budgetary allocation this fiscal because of the finance ministry's restrictions on spending.

The Executive Enclave will house the new Prime Minister's Office, Cabinet Secretariat, India House and the National Security Council Secretariat.

According to a revised proposal for environmental clearance to the Rs 1,381-crore project, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) recently informed the Delhi state-level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) that it would maintain 1,022 trees at the site, so as to have a tree per 80 square metre of plot area as per the guidelines of the Union environment ministry. In a meeting held on Apr 9, the SEAC recommended to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) to grant environmental clearance to the project which would come up on a plot area of 81,808 square meters.

In a meeting on Jan 31, the SEAC had asked the CPWD to increase the number of trees to be retained at the site.

About 80 per cent of existing trees are proposed to be removed. This is an excessively high number,"" the SEAC had said.

Based on the SEAC's recommendations, the CPWD revised the proposal, increasing the number of trees to be retained at the site to 320 from 154.

According to the new proposal, there are 807 trees at the site as compared to the earlier estimate of 784.

The CPWD also informed the panel that of the 487 trees to be transplanted, 397 will be transplanted at Raj Ghat and 90 on a plot in the vicinity.

The project proponent will retain 320 trees and plant an additional 702 trees at the site to meet the criteria of a tree per 80 square metre of plot area, it told the SEAC.

The redevelopment planned will, moreover cause severe environmental damage,"" the letter states.

It adds, Constructing a large number of multi-storeyed office buildings, with basements, in this open area will create congestion and irreversibly change and damage the environment.""

The Central Vista plan

In a controversial Rs 20,000-crore project, the Modi government seeks to redevelop the iconic Central Vista, and build a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat, revamp the 3-km Rajpath, build a new Parliament House on a 9.5-acre land near the existing building, reportedly shift the Prime Minister's residence and office near the South Block, and build the Vice-President's new house in the vicinity of the North Block.

Despite opposition against the plan on account of environmental degradation, obliteration of Indian heritage, and allegations of spending crores on this project at a time of a public health emergency, the government has not halted the project.

In their letter, the retired officers have also said the government has provided no details about the necessity of the project, and instead the purpose of the redevelopment seems to be to leave the stamp of a particular government on Delhi.

This project began, if reports are to be believed, because of a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is 'unlucky', as well as with the thought of leaving a particular government and its leader's impression on the architecture of Delhi,"" the letter states. There was no Parliamentary debate or discussion that preceded the decisions taken. Moreover, the redevelopment plans were not substantiated by any public consultation or expert review. Instead a hastily drafted and inappropriate tender was rushed through in record time to select an architectural firm in what was an extremely flawed process.""

It adds, The selected architectural firm appears to have been given carte blanche to make whatever changes it wishes, with all government departments seemingly mandated to do whatever is required to enable the firm's actions.""

The plan to concentrate offices of the central government in one place, moreover, belies the Modi government's own stated aim of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance"", the officers have said. This is against the basic tenets of the Master Plan of Delhi which stipulates that no new offices should be built in New Delhi and that efforts should be made to decongest it. It is also out of sync with the maxim of 'less government, more governance', which the present government had in its manifesto,"" the letter states.

Letter questions 'haste'

The officers have also raised questions over the haste"" with which the project is being pushed through despite an unprecedented countrywide lockdown, which has stalled all routine governance and economic activity throughout the country. It is sad to note that approvals of empowered supervisory bodies like the Environmental Assessment Committee of the Ministry of Environment and the Central Vista Committee have been pushed through in great haste at meetings convened at short notice while the country is in lockdown due to the Covid 19 epidemic, and despite the absence of private members who expressed their inability to attend and advised waiting till the nation returned to normalcy.""

The letter says, The clearances are being given despite the matters being sub judice. These bodies have, unfortunately, been reduced to mere rubber stamps with notes of dissent not even recorded.""

At a time when crores would be needed to boost the economy as it slumps in the face of the lockdown, the government trying to push a heritage redevelopment project of this nature is akin to Nero fiddling while Rome burned"", the officers have said.

We strongly believe that this project needs to be stopped forthwith for the multiple and complex reasons we have mentioned above. We appeal to the government to see the fallacy in going ahead with this project and to issue the necessary notifications forthwith to stop the work from going ahead.""

On Aug 4, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore had told Lok Sabha that the physical progress of the new Parliament building is 70 per cent. Nov is the deadline to complete the project, he had said. The sources said besides the COVID-19 pandemic, there were several other factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war affecting overseas deliveries, which impacted the construction work of the new parliament building.

When you look at the contract condition, there were also unforeseen circumstances mentioned in the document. The Ukraine-Russia war is an unforeseen circumstance and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was also an unforeseen circumstance,"" an official source told PTI.

Preparations are in full swing to hold the winter session in the existing Parliament building, another source said. The session will begin from Dec 7 and continue till Dec 29.

On Nov 4, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said construction work of the new Parliament building is going on at a very fast pace.

The new Parliament building is part of the redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor.

Revamping of the three-km Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, a common central secretariat, a new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president enclave are also part of the project.

The Modi government had set an ambitious Nov deadline for the completion of the project, which would have coincided with the 75th year of India's Independence. It had also planned to hold the Winter session inside the new Parliament to mark the occasion.

Senior government officials involved with the project said that while more than 75 per cent of civil work has been completed, the delay is on account of laying the broadcast infrastructure inside the new Parliament.

Officials are now focusing on building the control room from where the sophisticated broadcast equipment will be operated.

Work is progressing round-the-clock on the project site, but there has been delay in laying optic fibre cables for internet, power and video transmission,"" one of the senior officials told ThePrint.

Cables can't just be laid like that. Before that, the control room from where the sophisticated broadcast equipment will be operated has to be built. Work on the control room is likely to finish by Nov, after which the cables will be laid. This will be followed by system integration, testing and commissioning. It will take time,"" the official added.

A second government official said there was also some delay in procuring the broadcast infrastructure, which has to be imported. The war in Ukraine affected the supply chain, resulting in delays. But now the tender has been awarded for importing the broadcast equipment,"" the official said.

Officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs admitted that building a project of this scale in two years is a herculean task. Work on the new complex had started in Jan 2021.

A project of this scale takes at least four to five years. The building space is 65,000 square metres. But we have done extraordinary work. More than 75 per cent of the construction is complete. We are trying our best to finish the project within the timeline, but there can be some delay,"" one of the housing ministry officials said.

The official added that work on the Parliament building also started late. There was a court case going on, which delayed the project initially. Then the pandemic happened [second wave in Apr-May 2021] which disrupted work,"" said the official.

Escalating cost

The Central Public Works Department, which comes under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, is getting the Parliament project executed by Tata Projects. The delay in construction has resulted in the project cost escalating from Rs 971 crore to approximately Rs 1,200 crore.

The new Parliament will come up in front of the existing Parliament built 95 years ago. The latter will be eventually converted into a museum.

The triangular-shaped Parliament will have more space to accommodate MPs and officials. While the Lok Sabha will have 888 seats, the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats. The Lok Sabha Hall will have additional capacity of up to 1,272 seats to host joint sessions.

The new complex is part of the Central Vista revamp plan, which includes building a common central secretariat housing all central government ministries and departments, the Central Vista Avenue and the Executive Enclave, which will have the Prime Minister's Office, a new residence for the Prime Minister and a new Vice-President enclave. An important component of the complex will be a subterranean VIP tunnel that can be accessed from the PM's home office.

The Central Vista Avenue, now renamed as Kartavya Path, was inaugurated on 8 Sep.

The proposals were cleared by the DFS after the building designs were presented for approval by the government. The proposals came overriding resistance from the architects who said the changes will hamper the beauty of these buildings, they said.

The proposals include an internal road for fire tenders movement in case of high rise buildings and provisions for a fire check road for the protection of exits and staircases.

Pressurisation"" of the staircase and means of escape is another recommendation suggested wherever required in the building designs, they said.

Each of the seven proposals consist of plans for more than two buildings which were cleared between 2020-2022, they said.

These buildings are "" New Parliament Building, New PMO building, Amenity block, and Common Central secretariat being made under the Central Vista project, and a few other office buildings, besides Rajpath.

Other than these, various in-built fire-fighting arrangements are recommended to be installed in the buildings such as a fire exit, a hose reel, a wet riser, hydrants, an automatic sprinkler system, internal hydrants and yard hydrants, pumping arrangements, and captive water storage for fire-fighting, the fire officers said.

Automatic fire detection and alarming system, manual-operated electric fire alarm system and a public address system are also recommended as per National Building Code of India Chapter 4 on fire and fire safety.

All the recommendations suggested are being followed and implemented in the building designs which had altered,"" the officer said.

Atul Garg, Director of DFS said, The buildings under the Central Vista project have state-of-the-art technology as far as the fire department is considered. We have tried to provide the best infrastructure for the fire safety system. This is going to have in-built fire safety systems with a set up of a huge fire control room as well."" The fire officials said that initially it was not easy to convince the architects of the project to make certain specific changes in terms of fire safety system as they were of the view that any such changes could affect the beauty of the buildings.

However, after a lot of discussions and at least seven-eight rounds of meetings held with our retired service providers, architects and consultants involved in the project, they agreed to make all the necessary suggestions recommended by the fire department to ensure an efficient fire safety system,"" the director told PTI.

He said the fire safety system provided in each of these buildings is one of the best of its kind."" As it is a very important project, the fire department has suggested more fire fighting systems. All due precautions have been taken with reference to the fire safety system of the buildings and it will be a model building as far as the fire system is considered even though there was stiff resistance earlier."" Dr Sanjay Kumar Tomar, Deputy Chief Fire Officer said, the major recommendations suggested for each of these buildings include a fire safety arrangement, means of escape, and means of accessing and exiting the building with such considerations as the number, width, type and arrangement of sufficient number of exits.

Fire compartmentation, protection of exits through fire check doors, fire resistant material for construction of buildings as per unified by laws 2016 were also made to be incorporated in the design of the buildings, he said.

Several meetings with the architects and designers were held and they were convinced and agreed to make the changes and submitted the revised building plans which were approved by Delhi Fire Service,"" Tomar said.

The officer said that It is usually a routine process that before giving approval to buildings, parameters with respect to fire and life safety measures are scrutinised and deficiencies, shortcomings are conveyed so that those shortcomings can be removed."" Nowadays, all building plans are referred to Delhi Fire Service through the online portals of respective building sanctioning authorities such as Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Central Public Works Department, Public Work Department etc, he added.

According to the fire department, these building plans are either approved, and shortcomings if there are any are communicated online within 15 days of receipt of building plans.

In important projects of the government with fixed timeline, prior meetings are conducted to discuss fire safety measures according to their nature, such as if they are residential, educational, institutional (hospitals), business, mercantile, industrial, or are going to be used to store hazardous material.

Most of the buildings under the Central Vista project are divided into fire sub-compartments having fire resistant walls on all sides including top and bottom, which will help them contain fire within its origin, the fire officials said.

All openings (service ducts) in a fire compartment are sealed through fire resistant material. All exits are provided with fire check doors in a sub fire compartment, they said.

The buildings also have a smoke management system "" a very important provision to control smoke in case of fire, the fire officials said.

The buildings provide safe passage for the occupants and also facilitate fire-fighters to locate the origin of fire. This helps in controlling fire early leading to less damage.

The fire smoke contains harmful gases like hydrogen snide, carbon monoxide and HCL. These affect in three ways They are harmful poisonous gases, chemical irritants which impede escape by obscuring life,"" he added. PTI AMP AMP VN VN VN VN

The Justice Ramana-led collegium ended the 21-month-long logjam over appointment of judges to the apex court when nobody was appointed after the superannuation of the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi on Nov 17, 2019.

With the country witnessing an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19, the apex court passed several directions to assuage the miseries of the citizens. But the judiciary lost legal luminary Soli Sorabjee due to coronavirus. Another sad news came as the top court lost sitting judge Mohan M Shantanagoudar in Apr.

In a significant verdict, the apex court refused to refer to a larger bench to revisit its 29-year-old Mandal verdict, putting cap on quotas at 50 per cent, as it quashed a Maharashtra law granting reservations to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, saying it violated the principle of right to equality.

It also said that reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes in local bodies concerned in Maharashtra cannot exceed an aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and OBCs taken together.

Later in the year, it directed the State Election Commission of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to notify the seats reserved for the OBCs in local bodies in these two states for the general category.

The Centre got mixed results in 2020 in the apex court which gave the green signal to the strategic Chardham highway project near China border after taking note of security concerns and also junked pleas to stall the ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

The top court found no infirmity"" in grant of environment clearance and other permissions for the Central Vista and at the fag end, dismissed another plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where new residence of the Vice President is proposed.

It also upheld the Centre's power to extend Sanjay Kumar Mishra's tenure as Director of the Enforcement Directorate but clarified that extension of officers after the age of superannuation should be done rarely and in exceptional cases.

However, it trashed opposition of the government to pleas for probe into alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance and appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to investigate under the monitoring of former apex court judge R V Raveendran, saying the state cannot get a free pass"" every time the spectre of national security is raised and it cannot be the bugbear"" that the judiciary shies away from.

It also intervened to ensure fair probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people including four farmers were killed during a protest as it appointed Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to monitor the investigation of Uttar Pradesh SIT which will also have three IPS officers.

The apex court, which took back its 2020 order of extending period of limitation for filing cases due to the pandemic saying the country was returning to normalcy, again found itself in the midst of the brutal second wave and passed a slew of orders on issues ranging from delivery of oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, insurance for frontline workers, helping sex workers, migrant labourers, kids in street situation and those orphaned by COVID-19 and payment of ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of those who died of the infection.

Terming the resurgence of Covid cases as national crisis"", the CJI even advanced the Supreme Court's summer vacation and also ordered decongestion of prisons by ordering immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole in 2020.

The top court said black marketing of critical COVID-19 drugs and oxygen is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery and directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute offenders.

Highlighting the digital divide between rural and urban India, it posed searching queries to the Centre on mandatory registration on CoWIN for Covid jabs, vaccine procurement policy and differential pricing, saying the policy makers must have ears on ground to effectively deal with the unprecedented crisis.

At the fag end of the year, the court was dismayed over the poor air quality in Delhi-NCR and asked the Centre-appointed panel to work on finding a permanent solution to the menace.

The year also saw the Supreme Court staying till further orders the implementation of three farm laws and constituting a committee to listen to grievances of the protesting farmer unions', which held an over a year-long protest at Delhi borders, as also make recommendations to resolve the impasse.

The three farm laws were subsequently repealed leading to a situation where a clutch of pleas challenging their validity and others against the blockade by farmers in the apex court became infructuous.

The much-anticipated corporate battle resulted in a victory for the Tata Group with the top court setting aside appellate tribunal NCLAT's order which had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the USD 100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.

In a major victory for US-based e-commerce giant Amazon, the apex court held that Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator award, restraining the Rs 24,731 crore merger deal of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail, is valid and enforceable under Indian arbitration laws.

Nine years after taking up cudgels against Supertech, home buyers finally got relief from the top court as it ordered demolition of the under-construction twin 40-storey towers which would have blocked sunlight and fresh air, violating building norms in collusion with NOIDA officials.

During the year, it also put the curtains down on suo motu proceedings initiated to probe a larger conspiracy"" behind sexual harassment allegations against former CJI Gogoi in Apr 2019.

It also closed the nine-year-old criminal proceedings that were initiated in India against two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the Kerala coast in Feb 2012, after Rs 10 crore compensation was paid by Italy to heirs of the deceased and the boat owner.

It also said that according to the international arbitral award accepted by India, Italy shall resume further probe in the case against the marines "" Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.

In another significant verdict, the top court said the Delhi Assembly and its committee have the power to compel attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of privilege. PTI PKS ABA SJK ZMN

Speaking at an event on the 168th foundation day of the Central Public Works Department, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that India is witnessing an urban renaissance.

The CPWD, which comes under the HUA ministry, has been executing the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. The project also includes construction of a new PMO and prime minister's residence.

Puri said that the CPWD has steered important public works over the years, and has become a leading enterprise in the field of construction management.

The CPWD developed the National Capital Region in New Delhi with the execution of projects such as Rashtrapati Bhawan, North and South Block, and Parliament House, among other equally iconic projects, he said.

Even today, it (CPWD) is making a significant contribution to governance through the rejuvenation of the Central Vista project, with the development of the New Parliament Building, VP Enclave, and Common Central Secretariat,"" he said.

Speaking at the event, HUA Secretary Manoj Joshi said that the agency should also focus on quality contractors and new technology.

Last week, Puri had said that the redevelopment project of the Central Vista Avenue, stretching from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, would be completed by Jul 18.

He had said some minor works are currently being carried out at one or two underpasses, which are likely to be completed soon. PTI BUN ZMN

The Central Public Works Department's proposal for terms of reference, which is a step before the application for environment clearance, was discussed by the MoEF Expert Appraisal Committee on Thursday, according to sources. A source said the CPWD was given suggestions and asked to address the issues raised in representations from the public.
The CPWD on Dec 9 submitted a proposal for TOR for the development/redevelopment of Common Central Secretariat buildings and Central Conference Centre along with Prime Minister's Residence, SPG Building and Vice President's Enclave,"" with a total built-up area of 17,21,500 square metre and demolition of 4,58,820 sqm. This plan did not include the proposed PMO that was mentioned in an earlier version of the proposal submitted in Nov. The source said there were issues of pending land-use change and litigation.
'Integrated approach'
The CPWD had first submitted a plan for the 10 secretariat buildings and conference centre and the TOR which was approved in Oct. Then, the CPWD applied for amending the TOR to include the PMO, PM's residence, SPG building and V-P's Enclave, but the EAC in its meeting on Nov 25 returned the proposal. The EAC asked the agency to refrain from piecemeal approach"" and apply again with an integrated approach,"" according to the minutes of the meeting.
Among those who submitted their representations to the EAC was former MoEF secretary Meena Gupta, a retired IAS officer. Ms. Gupta wrote to the chairperson of the EAC, T. Haque, that the CPWD had once again arbitrarily added and subtracted components of the Central Vista redevelopment and this completely undermines the directions of the EAC given during the last meeting."" She added that there was no explanation given for removing the PMO from the plan and other components, including the new Parliament, the New India Garden and underground transit system had not been included.
Ms. Gupta told The Hindu that the approach had been slipshod"" and piecemeal"". Such an important project should not be taken up like this,"" she said.
The EAC had approved the CPWD's proposal to construct a new Parliament in Apr. As a part of the government's larger plan to redevelop the 3-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, construction on the new Parliament was set to start this month. The government, however, submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court earlier this month that it would not start construction, demolition and tree transplantation till the court gives its decisions in cases challenging the project.

There is a court case with regard to some plans that need to be sorted out but the tri-city plans are still on,"" said a senior State official.

Mr. Patel, a leading architect especially in the space of public buildings and projects, is the man behind the Central Vista project redrawing the Parliament building and much of office space of the Central ministries. He had designed the Ahmedabad riverfront project, and is currently involved in the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram, which was established by Mahatma Gandhi.
Jagan Mohan's election
The capital of Andhra Pradesh had earlier been finalised as Amaravati and extensive land acquisition via land pooling had taken place. The election of Jagan Mohan Reddy as Chief Minister in 2019, however, led to a change of plans and a slew of legal challenges and counter challenges, including one on the new government's plans to divide the capital into three areas.
On the question of why Visakhapatnam was chosen by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government as the site of a new capital, a senior YSRCP leader said the city had both an airport and a seaport, offices of major Public Sector Undertakings and a potential to become a metropolis.""
With many brakes with regard to the formation of a capital ever since the split of the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, it is being hoped that finalising a design vision may make the prospects of a new capital coming into being more real.

The dream of a new capital for Brazil, where all development and people had thus far crowded into coastal cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, was more than a century old. It was even written into the Brazilian Constitution in 1891, but only commissioned in 1956, when President Juscelino Kubitschek saw it as the base for his slogan '50 years of development in 5'.
By now, the dream of Brasilia was about much more than a new city "" it was to be the flag-bearer of Brazilian democracy, of a modern, progressive outlook for the country, and an egalitarian society that would allow the people living more inland, some much-needed development "" all of which would go into the capital's design.

Wah! Taj in my living room: The possibilities of post-pandemic architecture
The city was designed, much like Washington D.C.'s Mall, and Lutyen's New Delhi, around a 'central vista'. The vista included the Presidential Palace, Parliament building and offices at one end, government buildings down the way and then planned housing shaped in 'super quadras', all leading down to the Brasilia bus stop at the other end.
The 'Plano Piloto' or city plan for Brasilia, made by architect L�cio Costa.
The 'Plano Piloto' or city plan "" likened to a bird, a bow and arrow, or an airplane "" was made by architect L�cio Costa, along with buildings designed by the world-famous architect Oscar Niemeyer, who chose concrete as his medium for its 'flow', and structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo, who brought form to the concrete. The entire plan, including an artificial lake built by damming two nearby rivers, was completed in an astounding 41 months, and inaugurated in 1960.

More than 60 years later, the making of Brasilia is the subject of an exhibition at New Delhi's National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), curated by Brazilian Ambassador Andr� Aranha Corr�a do Lago, himself an architecture enthusiast, who knew Niemeyer before his death in 2012. The exhibition which includes photographs, tapestries, tiles and even modernistic furniture from Brazil, begins with a full model of Brasilia's main avenue: a central vista within Delhi's Central Vista, as it were.
Every Brasilia building has a unique style, says the Ambassador. The presidential offices, and the Itamaraty Palace (Foreign Ministry) are built low and wide, the Parliament buildings tower as two conjoined skyscrapers over the city, but all have one important similarity: Niemeyer's designed pillars. Unlike the grand colonial columns favoured in other capitals, Niemeyer drew his pillars as 'feminine' L-shaped wings, tapering at the top and bottom to give the buildings the sense that they barely touch the ground while they reach for the sky at the other end.

Another important feature of all the buildings is that the approach and entrance to each building is different. At the Itamaraty Palace, for instance, dignitaries are led across a waterbody into the building and up a grand set of iconic bannister-less stairs. When it rains, cars come through a long tunnel and dignitaries alight inside a hall on the first floor that visually opens the building up in a controlled manner.

The iconic Cathedral of Brasilia, shaped like a gigantic upside-down flower supported by massive steel columns and meshed with blue and white stained glass, has a similarly surprising entrance. At others, Niemeyer built ramps for entry, guiding pedestrians to appreciate the architectural highlights gradually as they walk up. Buildings in the residential area are all built on stilts, allowing for gardens below that give residents an unlimited park area to walk across, with shaded areas in between.

Niemeyer said that the first impact was for the common man in the street to have a look at the building, find it interesting and remember something that is different from his everyday life,"" says Corr�a do Lago. Be it in the Presidential Residence or office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Parliament building or Supreme Court building, each experience is very, very different and I think this is one of the secrets of Niemeyer's success.
'Elegant monotony'
While many have marvelled at what is called Brasilia's concrete El Dorado"", six decades of existence have also highlighted its many failures. Brasilia is a capital, but not a city, and lacks a vibrant street life. The 'hotel district' for instance, is like an aerocity, where tourists are confined to seeing only other hotels and other tourists, rather than mixing with the locals. (After a visit, feminist author Simone de Beauvoir described it as elegant monotony"".)

Part of the problem is that planned cities such as Brasilia, Chandigarh (Niemeyer drew inspiration from Le Corbusier's modernist style), Islamabad and others are imagined grid-like, in squares, unlike historic cities like London, Rome, Shanghai, Kolkata and Lahore. Brasilia's population is now about 4.8 million, but many of the people live in satellite towns, which have grown more organically around the main capital area.
The original plan for an egalitarian city structure has also made way as more elite prime real estate comes up closer to the water's edge. Even so, Brasilia has shown a path to other countries seeking to rebuild their narrative through the construction of a new capital: from Malaysia's Putrajaya, Nigeria's Abuja, Myanmar's Nyapitaw, to Indonesia's Nusantara and South Korea's Sejong.

While the debate over building a new city rather than restoring an old one will continue, the lasting impact of any construction made with considered thought, is undeniable. Explaining the purpose of his architecture, Niemeyer famously said, Humanity needs dreams to endure misery, even if just for an instant.""
'Bras�lia 60+ and the Construction of Modern Brazil' is at NGMA, New Delhi, till Jul 31, and will then travel to Chandigarh and other cities.

In fact, amid the nation's chaotic battle against COVID-19, the Centre has been rushing ahead, ignoring pleas to pause it for further deliberations. The plan is also to construct a new Parliament building by Mar 2022 and a common central secretariat by Mar 2024 along with new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President near South and North Blocks which will be repurposed as museums. There will be a new building for the PMO. A draft master plan by a private firm contracted by the government has proposed a triangular-shaped Parliament building next to the existing heritage structure, and office buildings all along Rajpath, after demolishing existing buildings. Till date, the government has not publicly stated the project's estimated cost. The construction of the new parliament building, according to the CPWD application for environmental clearance for the project on Mar 12, is estimated to cost 922 crore. The Centre has given a range of reasons behind the redevelopment plan, from the structural safety of the Parliament building and the North and South Blocks, which came up between 1911 and 1931, and once delimitation is done and the number of seats increase, to the need for more space to seat MPs and office space for all of them. For the post-Independence buildings such as Shastri Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan, it has cited the need for modern workspaces.
The decision on redevelopment was taken in a hurry and without adequate consultations. The utility of such a massive redevelopment is not easily defendable but the Modi government is evidently eager to recondition the capital's landscape as its monumental legacy. The Opposition, environmentalists, architects and citizens have raised a range of concerns even before the pandemic brought in additional issues. But far from pausing, several key approvals for the proposed Parliament building have been pushed during the lockdown, leading to allegations of a lack of transparency. Independent expert members of the Central Vista Committee could not attend the meeting where it was passed without much discussion, as per the minutes of the meeting. The process for change of land use by the Delhi Development Authority was completed just before the lockdown began on Mar 25. Activists and architects have questioned the lack of studies to ascertain the need for the project and its impact on the environment, traffic and pollution. There were enough reasons to be circumspect about this grand idea from the very beginning. In the situation created by the pandemic, it must be deferred and the idea revisited later.

The petition has questioned the validity of a notification issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Oct 28, 2020, notifying the change in land use by proposing modification to Zonal Development Plan of Zone 'D' for plot number one in the Central Vista area of Lutyens Delhi.
Recreational area is proposed to be modified to residential area... It has not demonstrated any public interest in the proposed change in land use here,"" Mr. Suri contended.
Mr. Mehta confirmed orally to the court that the official residences of the Vice-President and the Prime Minister were stipulated for this plot.
So, the public recreational area is not available now? Is the recreational area going to be transposed to some other area,"" Justice Khanwilkar asked the top law officer.
Security reasons
Mr. Mehta said the play area could be shifted to some other area. But he cited security reasons too.
The Parliament, etc, is coming up nearby... It may not be possible to have a recreational area there,"" the Solicitor General submitted.
Mr. Mehta said the government would file its affidavit shortly. He convinced the Bench to list the case for urgent hearing again on Friday (Oct 29).
Mr. Suri argued that the proposed modification violates right to life itself"".
The change in land use will deprive residents of Delhi and citizens of India a vast chunk of highly-treasured open and green space in the Central Vista... Right to life includes the right to enjoyment of a wholesome life,"" Mr. Suri argued.
In Jan, the Supreme Court, in a majority verdict, had given the government the go-ahead to the multi-crore Central Vista redevelopment project.
The verdict had focussed on the building of a new Parliament three times bigger than the existing 93-year-old heritage building and was concerned with the modification in the use of 86.1 acres of land home to India's power corridor.
In their majority opinion, Justices Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari had said the government did not act against public trust. The Opposition had accused the government of spending public money on the redevelopment project when the country was battling the COVID-19 pandemic and unemployment with scant resources.
Justice Sanjeev Khanna, in his minority view, opined that there should have been more public consultation involved.
The majority judgment, however, had accepted the government's view that the Central Vista project aimed at an integrated administration block"" and synergised functioning"" of Ministries at present spread across 47 buildings in the region, and in particular, Central Secretariat block.

New Delhi / public works & infrastructure",Monumental hurry: On Central Vista project - The Hindu,3,2020
655,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/central-vista-sc-asks-govt-to-file-affidavit-on-proposed-change-in-land-use/article37158326.ece,"After the 2019 fire that devastated Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, an international competition was held to generate the widest range of ideas for its roof rehabilitation. With 30,000 people voting on the new vision, a public ballot was used to finalise the new design as transparently as possible, and the design submitted by two Chinese architects, Zeyu Cai and Sibei Li, was selected.
Compare that to the manner in which the project for India's new Parliament House, euphemistically called 'a project that will become a symbol of national pride', has been conducted. Cloaked in a veil of secrecy and mired in opaque processes, the project sailed through mandatory approvals and now even the tender for construction has been awarded.
Artist's impressions of the proposed redevelopment of Central Vista
What most people don't remember is that in 2008, the Delhi Government, in collaboration with Intach, began work on a detailed dossier to earn the prestigious Imperial Capital Cities status from UNESCO. The dossier was submitted to UNESCO in 2012. However, when the time came for the final consideration in 2015, the government abruptly withdrew the application.
While conservationists were left bewildered at the government's about face, the real reason soon became clear. If the status had been granted at the time, it would have frozen all future development in the Central Vista zone, effectively preventing the government from unlocking the huge potential of this priceless real estate.
Although the formal proposal for the revamp of the Vista and the project to build a new Parliament House came only in 2019, the Central government has been working behind closed doors from 2015 onwards. The first hint of the interventions only became known when the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) issued invitations to architects to submit financial and design bids for the proposed work in early Sep. The tender process was rushed through with a speed that is seldom seen in government work.
No information
Within six weeks of inviting bids (Sept 2, 2019), the tender was finalised on Oct 18, 2019. The criteria for eligibility disqualified firms below a certain fixed turnover, leaving only a handful of multinational and engineering companies to compete.
Artist's impressions of the proposed redevelopment of Central Vista
Six bids were received, with each architect making a closed-door presentation to a select jury; eventually the project was awarded to HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd. of Ahmedabad with an architectural fee of nearly 230 crore. The deadline for the completion of Parliament House was fixed for Mar 2022, in time to mark the 75th year of independence, and the start of Parliament's monsoon session.
In a project of national significance, the government felt it owed no explanation to the public for either the process followed, or the criteria for selection. No exhibition of the proposed buildings was held, no data revealed, no models or drawings displayed so that citizens may comprehend the full scope of such a monumental change proposed in the city's most visible public space and a space of national significance.
The Central Vista, meanwhile, had already been accorded the highest Grade I heritage status by the Unified Building Bye-Laws of Delhi. Buildings with Grade I classification cannot be changed, and no intervention can be made unless it is in the interest of strengthening and prolonging the life of the buildings"".
Any redevelopment or alteration would have to follow due processes of the Heritage Conservation Committee, a committee that can only act after inviting and answering objections from the public. Demolition is not considered in the heritage agenda.
Raisina Hill
However, to facilitate the large-scale demolitions proposed in the new Central Vista plan, the Heritage Conservation Committee made a distinction between pre-Independence and post-Independence buildings to redefine the status of 'heritage'. Consequently, rock-solid post-independence constructions, built by Indian architects and engineers in the 60s, have been deprecatingly consigned to the hammer.
The distinction permitted the demolition and replacement of buildings like Krishi Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Rail Bhavan, in addition to the National Museum and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). Only the existing Parliament building, the North and South Blocks, and the National Archives were spared on account of their pre-Independence stature. No debate preceded the decision nor did an impartial expert committee assess what constituted heritage, whether colonial or modern. Nor indeed was there any public consultation or announcement. The Grade I heritage status, it seems, was meant only for paper.
Change in land use
Once these closed-door decisions had been made, it was a matter of bringing the project to life. And the first task was the change of land use. A public notice was issued by the Delhi Development Authority proposing changes in Dec 2019, which, in effect, asked that the use of public open spaces such as a district park and children's play area be changed for use as government offices. Challenging this, a Public Interest Petition "" Rajeev Suri vs. the Union of India "" was filed in the Delhi High Court in Mar 2020, stating that the land use change was illegal and violated Article 21 of the Constitution because it deprived citizens of their legitimate right to open green spaces. A second petition was filed by LokPATH, a citizen's group that challenged the manner in which a public project of this scale was being conducted; yet another was filed regarding violations of the heritage status of Central Vista by a group headed by architect A.G.K Menon. The petitions were transferred to the Supreme Court and are now in the apex court's domain.
Parliament House
Still, given the project's high priority, the wheels of approvals continued to turn despite the country being under lockdown. On Apr 22, the new Parliament building was granted environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change. Without an environmental impact study, and despite over 1,200 recorded objections raised by citizens, the Central Vista Committee headed by the CPWD "" despite the conflict of interest "" issued a 'No Objection' certificate.
A CPWD tender was hastily pushed through in a wholly opaque selection process. Although the matter is still sub judice and hearings are ongoing, the tendered project has already been awarded to Tata Projects Ltd with a 21-month construction deadline.
It is disturbing but telling that a project of the scale, magnitude, public expense and national significance of the Central Vista can cruise through the strictest of constitutional guidelines, heritage laws, land use and environmental regulations, and city bye-laws, all in the time frame of a few months. Beyond the misappropriation of public funds and violations of statuary regulations, what does this say about the structure of public governance and the quality of life generated by such actions?
Consider something else. When a public space has accrued through a slow additive process, with only a narrow-minded protection strategy and no future planning projection, perhaps the history of the Central Vista then is itself flawed.
An aerial view of the Parliament and adjoining government buildings that comprise Central Vista
The original layout was formed from the vision of British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who combined institutions of governance with those of culture and the arts in a version of European Classicism that was spread along the broad three-kilometre sunny stretch of India Gate.
Faceless modernism
A faceless modernism came subsequently when an independent country needed to add departmental bureaucracy to the mix "" what was referred to as 'government-style bhawans'. In 1986, an international competition for the design of IGNCA was called, to fill the gaping hole across the National Archives and create a comprehensive cultural centre for the city. Only a third of that winning scheme was realised: the arts centre today is an incomplete residue of old barracks, a mud structure, and the partial granite addition.
Across from IGNCA sits the new External Affairs headquarters, which in the Lutyens-Baker plan was designated for cultural activities. Designed and completed in 1995, the MEA project began as an architectural competition but was summarily dismissed by the then External Affairs minister and awarded to the CPWD. The architecture is in the PWD formula "" a mix of sandstone and glass with a smattering of domes and arches.
Given these piecemeal additions, the Central Vista has become not just a work in progress, but a work in incoherence. Thankfully, the place has remained free of the monolithic visions of Mussolini's New Rome and Speer's Berlin, the architectural gigantism and grim territorial finality of which make public life a monument rather than a space.
The Vista's most obvious architectural relative remains the Washington Mall, which in its last half a century has added a range of art galleries, museums and cultural institutions, becoming the most visible public space in the American capital. The Indian version "" half baked, incomplete, jaded and unkempt, part-maidan, part-building "" has at least so far remained true to the ways of Indian governance.
In the final analysis, beyond the bickering and the lawsuits, the hasty sanctions and approvals, the Central Vista project is both the cause and effect of its own multiple failures.
On the one hand, a preservationist view places a protectionist stranglehold on the site, forbidding a change of thinking; on the other is a professional imperative that demands a calculated display of correctness in the practice of public architecture. In the long perspective, however, the two still leave a great deal unsaid.
Architectural future
How does a country, unsteady in democratic principles and lacking blueprints of development, ensure a visible architectural future for itself? The concern for expressing the independence of institutions without their actual practice of autonomy, the apologetic insertions of culture in a largely bureaucratic mix, and the continual harking back to some selective aspects of urban history, only demonstrate the futility of the ideas expressed "" tentative, incomplete, unmade and so, always unfulfilled.
A passive society on the lookout for convenient symbols will continue to recall the great democratic stage sets of ancient Greece and Rome. Lutyens alluded to them in architectural forms that were British and regal, personalised to his own interpretation. The India of our time requires urban nourishment that may not be similarly embalmed in formal institutions, but that encapsulates art and music and history and beauty in a new and vivid experience. When the real city is fast becoming a place of temporal migratory displacement, the need to step outside the formalism of static architecture is an essential and altogether new resolve.
Sadly, when change is invoked for its own sake; when symbols are called into convenient play without rationale, unaffected by the logistics of finance or need-based design, then designs follow neither the demands of public spaces nor the grim realities of annual budgets and global pandemics but set a course of their own pyrrhic making. The logic of their creation is fuelled by private nationalism, not public desire. It is here that the Central Vista project becomes a venture in self-doubt.

Speaking to The Hindu about the design of the whole Central Vista project, which includes the new Parliament, Secretariat buildings and Prime Minister's residence, HCP Design, Planning and Management managing director Bimal Patel, who is the Centre's consultant for the project, said the goal was to create something that a large number of Indians connected with.
The aesthetic preferences of Indians are very diverse. Some have very avant-garde tastes, while others have very traditional preferences. National icons have to resonate with this very wide diversity of tastes. Corbusier, when he designed Chandigarh, was not required to create an architecture that would resonate with a wide range of Indians  an architecture that they could relate with, find meaningful, and think of as their own. Lutyens was required to do so when he designed New Delhi. We are very much trying to create an architecture that speaks to a wide range of Indians and resonates with them,"" he said.
The redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue, which started in Feb and is the first project under the larger Central Vista revamp nearing completion, was still a work in progress when this correspondent visited the site on Dec 21. Workers were busy giving the granite pathways along the lawns a flame finish, in order to make the stone less slippery. Cranes carrying materials moved up and down Rajpath, while bleachers ordered for the parade lay under covers on the lawns.

As a part of the government's larger redevelopment of the Central Vista area, three buildings of the new CCS are coming up at the site of the erstwhile Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) campus on Janpath. The project was awarded by the Central Public Works Department to Larsen and Toubro Ltd. on Oct 27, 2021, for 3,141.99 crore, the largest contract given by the CPWD till then, and is currently under construction.
In connection with the CCS project, some mock-ups and a steel shed were to be constructed at 9, Janpath, an empty plot right next to Mr. Nadda's residence at 7-B, Motilal Nehru Marg, according to the sources. However, the work was stopped soon after it was started, they said.

Asked for a comment, a CPWD spokesperson declined, but added that the agency had already replied to the PG complaint in this matter"", referring to the public grievance redressal system. L&T spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.
When asked for comment on the matter, a Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry spokesperson said the site was changed when a more convenient spot became available and that the construction of the CCS buildings itself would not be affected.
One mock-up of the office is required to be constructed before carrying out large-scale finishing works in CCS buildings being constructed at the IGNCA plot between Mansingh Road and Janpath. Earlier, it was planned to be constructed at 9, Janpath as no suitable land was available nearby. Only preparatory work was taken up there.
Later, the Defence Ministry agreed to give land for providing storage and labour accommodation on temporary basis in Princess Park on C-Hexagon, which is near the site and more convenient. It was therefore decided to construct the mock-up office at Princess Park. As the CCS building is still at the basement level, there will not be any impact on project timeline due to shifting of site for mock-up,"" the spokesperson said.
The first three buildings of the CCS are a part of 10 new buildings proposed to be built by 2026 to house all Union Ministries and provide for a conference centre.

Most of these are violations of the dust control rules of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that are supposed to be followed at all construction sites, to avoid the dangerous particulate matter (PM) emanating from construction waste causing respiratory ailments to people.
From Mansingh Road towards Akbar Road, heaps of uncovered earth could be seen lying on pavements. Pavements next to green metal sheets, which formed the boundary of the redevelopment work, were broken at many places, exposing the soil. Towards the left, beyond the green metal sheets where work was happening, one could clearly see heaps of soil and demolition waste.
As per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules 2016, every waste generator should keep the construction and demolition waste within the premise and ensure that there is no littering of the waste preventing obstruction to traffic, public or drains. 
Also, those carrying out such construction are to be held prima-facie be responsible"" for collection, segregation of concrete, soil, and other waste, and for storage of construction and demolition waste generated, as per rules.
When contacted, the spokesperson of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), under which the redevelopment work is happening, said he has forwarded the issue to the officials concerned. 
At the intersection of Janpath and Rajpath, grey-colour construction sand was dumped on the pavement without it being covered. 
As per the CPCB guidelines for dust control issued in Nov 2017, based on the 2016 rules, sheets made of plastic, tarpaulin etc. should be used to cover construction material that is easily airborne and also for the debris that is dumped at temporary storage sites.
The CPCB had in its 2017 guidelines identified, along with photos, problems similar to the ones seen around central vista redevelopment.
Where the buck stops
After seeing photos from the area, Polash Mukerjee, Lead for Air pollution at the India programme of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said that it appears to be a clear violation"" of rules.
Compliance with dust pollution rules has increased in the past four to five years in Delhi-NCR, but it's still not 100%. In this case, it is less maybe because it's a high-level project,"" he said.
Mr. Mukerjee said that in many countries abroad, the onus of proving that you are following pollution control norms at construction sites is on the contractor or the project owner, but in India it lies on the government.
Giving examples of best practices followed by other countries, Mr. Mukherjee added, In California, the contractor has to install localised air pollution monitoring sensors at the construction site to measure pollution levels. This helps to keep a check on dust pollution.""

Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notices to the Centre and the DDA and sought their response within two weeks. The court also directed the DDA to approach it before taking a decision to notify the proposed changes in Master Plan Delhi 2020-21.
Eight new government office buildings, a new Parliament House and a residential complex near the South Block that could house the homes of the Prime Minister and the Vice-President are among the projects under consideration for the redevelopment of the Central Vista.
One of the petitioners, Rajeev Suri, has asserted that there is change in land-use in as much as the green areas which is described as recreational"". District Park is proposed to house the new government house. Mr. Suri's plea claimed that the DDA has relied upon 2001 Zonal Development Plan in respect of the proposed changes. His plea contended that the alterations which are proposed will involve the change of land-use and standards of population density.
Such a change in land use will deprive Delhi of its most iconic Central Vista, steeped in historicity and known for pomp and pageantry of the Republic of India,"" the plea said, claiming that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes,
The second petition by Lt. Col. Anuj Srivastava (Retd.) and others challenges the public hearing which was held subsequently terming it as a mere formality"". The DDA had invited comments or objections for the change of land use for the project. In the petition,he argued that about 1,292 objections were submitted to the DDA out of which 200 objections were dealt with summarily.
The plea pointed out that extremely short notice"" was issued to the parties for the public hearing.
A one-day notice for public hearing does not allow people to make arrangements to be present at the public hearing,"" the plea said. It said about 1,292 people were called for hearing within a few hours over just two days during the middle of the week.

While the plan to use granite around India Gate has been shelved for now, the stone pavement replacing the sand path along Rajpath has been tweaked to be coarser at the point where the President's Bodyguard salute the President on Jan 26.
Architect Bimal Patel, whose firm HCP Design, Planning and Management, is the Centre's consultant for the entire Central Vista redevelopment project, said during a presentation at CEPT University in Ahmedabad on Oct 22 that the  bajri "" (sand) along the road was being replaced with granite. He explained the idea of laying the footpath was to include infrastructure under it, replacing the temporary utilities installed for Republic Day parades every year.
When we are doing these new things, everybody is against it, or not against it but apprehensive. When we did the granite paving, we are looking at it and saying fantastic, it looks good. But these guys who bring their horses during the Republic Day parade said 'no, no, no, hamare ghode nahi chalenge' [our horses won't walk]. We had to do an experiment and let them ride on it,"" said Mr. Patel, who is also the president of CEPT University.
He added that the conclusion was that the paving would work, but the one place where the guards salute the President, the paving should be more granular"".
When asked what the concerns had been, HCP told The Hindu in a written response on Monday: The horses were not facing any issues. The same paving as the rest of the area will continue along the pathway, with a more coarse finish to ensure additional friction"".
On the other hand, the portion around India Gate that was proposed to be changed from bitumen to granite cobblestone, but the project's tight deadline (before R-Day 2022) meant it had to be dropped for now. During the parade, heavy equipment like the Arjun Main Battle Tank (around 60 tonnes) and India's longest-range ballistic missile Agni-V (launch weight of 50 tonnes) roll down Rajpath.
We didn't have enough time to do samples and discover what would be the right way to do cobblestones that would take the weight of tanks. World over streets made of granite cobblestone take the weight of tanks, so in theory it is possibleBut everybody was apprehensive that the granite should not get damaged,"" Mr. Patel said.
He said the first sample that was made did not pass the test and there wasn't enough time to re-do samples. He said it was decided to drop the idea for now and try out samples at a different location in the future.
Asked when the cobblestone around India Gate would be installed, HCP said: There is no timeline for this. It will be done as and when an appropriate material and technique for laying the flooring is developed"".

Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav said the High Court erred in concluding that the workers stayed at the site whereas they were brought in daily from outside at a time when restrictions were in place on public movement to halt the spread of the virus, which has claimed thousands of lives.
The High Court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with a huge number of innocent laborers workers to continue during peak COVID-19 Pandemic period is a serious public health issue concern,"" Mr. Yadav's petition said.

Movement pass was issued to labourers and supervisors to construction site,"" the petition said.

The government's decision to go ahead with the construction of Parliament and the Central Vista Avenue while the country grapples with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn the ire of the Opposition.
In a series of tweets, Mr. Puri said: Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre.
Cost of Central Vista is about 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India's healthcare budget for just this year was over 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities.""

It was only the contracts for the new Parliament building and the revamp of the Central Vista Avenue that had been awarded for 862 crore and 477 crore respectively so far, while the other components of the plan would be spread over many years.

In their majority opinion, Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said the court cannot order the government to desist from spending money on one project and use it for something else. They said the government did not act against public trust.
Opinion | Beyond the veils of secrecy, the Central Vista project is both the cause and effect of its own multiple failures
They brushed aside allegations that the government committed foul play and illegally carved out the Parliament project from the Central Vista project. 
The proposed Parliament House has a built-up area of 65,000 sq.m and is scheduled to be completed in 2022, in time for the 75th Independence Day celebrations and the Global G-20 summit. The Central Vista project aims for an integrated administration block"" and synergised functioning"" of ministries presently spread across 47 buildings in the region, and in particular, Central Secretariat block.

It dismissed notions that the project was sui generis"" (unique) and deserved a heightened judicial review"".
Also read: SC reserves judgment in Central Vista case
The right to development is a basic human right and no organ of the state is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law,"" Justice Khanwilkar wrote.
Justice Sanjeev Khanna, in a separate dissent, upheld the project bid notice, award of consultancy and the order of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission, but concluded that the Centre did not take the public into confidence about the changes proposed for Central Vista, an area, which in post-Independent India, inspires and connects common people to the citadels of our democracy"".

Justice Khanna said public consultation was neither sensible or meaningful. He quashed the land change notification and referred the project back to the Heritage Conservation Committee to ensure better public participation. 
He said the access of the common people to the green and other areas in the Central Vista would be curtailed/restricted"". 
Justice Khanna also disagreed with the majority view and set aside the environmental clearance given by the Ministry to the Parliament building project. 
The public should be provided not only with information about the draft scheme but also an outline of realistic alternatives and indication of main reasons for the authority's adoption of the draft scheme,"" Justice Khanna noted.
Justice Khanwilkar, however, maintained there was nothing clandestine"" about the project. He said a personal communication was sent to all the 1,292 objectors.
The proposal was placed before the parliamentary committee, chaired by the Lok Sabha Speaker and constituting MPs of major national political parties, at the inception stage itself. The Lok Sabha Secretariat had approved the budget estimate and concept plan.
But Justice Khanna pointed out that the SMS and emails of the public notice of hearing was sent out at the last moment"". Objectors did not get reasonable time to orally state their point of view.
The various facets of the project under challenge in court included the change in land use in the Central Vista under the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the permissions and approvals granted by the Central Vista Committee, the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) and the clearance/no-objection for construction of a new Parliament House under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. 
The petitioners had also alleged that the government failed to take prior permission/approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) under the Unified Building Bye-Laws of 2016.
The majority view held the Centre's exercise of power to change the land use under Section 11A(2) of the Delhi Development Authority Act, 1957 was just and proper"". Justice Khanwilkar said the environment clearance was valid.
The land use change met the present need for better governance and proper development in the National Capital, Justice Khanwilkar maintained.
The proposed changes fully gel with the vision of the Master Plan including the Zonal Plan. Basic principle behind the Master Plan is to tread the path of development... Section 11A(1) empowers the Authority to make modifications in the master plan or the zonal plan,"" Justice Khanwilkar wrote.
But Justice Khanna pointed out that the area has several heritage buildings like the Parliament House, National Archives, North Block, South Block as well as the Central Vista precincts which are specifically graded as Grade-I.
Central government could not have notified the modified the land use changes without following the procedure and without prior approval/permission from the Heritage Conservation Committee... The local body i.e. NDMC should have approached the Heritage Conservation Committee for clarification/confirmation and proceed on their advice,"" Justice Khanna said.
The majority opinion found no infirmity in the no objection"" given by the Central Vista Committee, saying it was done after an elaborate process"".
However, Justice Khanna said four independent representatives were missing at a crucial meeting held on Apr 30, leaving only the government's men in attendance.
Thus, the contention that the meeting was a premeditated effort to ensure approval without the presence and participation of representatives of professional bodies is apparent and hardly needs any argument,"" Justice Khanna concluded.
Justice Khanwilkar upheld the approval given by the DUAC for the Parliament building. He said the DUAC's mandate was limited to advice on the overall aesthetic quality of the region. The majority judgment found the allegations of favouritism in the selection of consultant as baseless.
The majority opinion held that as regards the new Parliament building project, the concern of heritage conservation did not arise directly. 
The court, however, took note of the concerns raised that the new Parliament is proposed to be built in a vacant space adjacent to existing Parliament House. It said the HCC was free to consider the proposal in accordance with law.
This did not prevent the court from upholding the prior approval"" accorded by the HCC before processing the proposal for change of use of the listed heritage building/listed precincts.
It went on to distinguish between 'prior approval' and 'prior permission' of the HCC under the Building Bye Laws of 2016.
The stage of prior permission is the stage when actual development/redevelopment work is to commence and not the incipient stage of planning and formalisation of the project, including the new Parliament,"" the court said.
The court said the government should obtain prior permission of the designated Authority - Commissioner, MCD, Vice Chairman, DDA and Chairman, NDMC - before the actual development/redevelopment work, if it has not already obtained it.

His point is that the project serves a very limited purpose when the country is going through a crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and its catastrophic impact on the economy.
Mr. Viswam said that with the number of infections crossing the 4.5-lakh mark and the number of deaths nearing 15,000, the pandemic was showing no sign of ending any time soon. The economy had been pushed off the brink, he said. He said it was essential that the government focus its energy and resources on meeting the fundamental needs of the people. I urge you to suspend a project that has been allocated large funding but serves a very limited purpose "" the redevelopment of the Central Vista in New Delhi,"" he wrote. The Centre has allocated 20,000 crore for the project, which includes a new building for Parliament.
Given the larger issues that plagued the nation now, ...ranging from mass unemployment, a crippling economy, social disharmony, environmental decay and a health pandemic that threatens our very existence"", the project must be at the bottom of the list of priorities for the government, he wrote.
Mr. Viswam said the project lacked social and historical context. There have been no public consultations on this process, no environmental or social impact studies, no expert opinions of historians, urban planners, architects, sociologists and other professionals. Instead, the entire process has been hidden in a veil of secrecy and opaqueness."" It would be deeply problematic to continue with the project, he said.

669,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/suspend-central-vista-project-demands-cpi-leader/article31901905.ece,"The Government of India's Central Vista redevelopment project is highly questionable as a national priority at any time, and more so in the midst of a pandemic. The project includes the construction of a new Parliament building , and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President. A new Parliament building is indeed required; and there is a strong case for reorganising the existing offices of the central government. However, the architecture and timelines of the redevelopment as it is happening now are less about the need and more about an imperious obsession with grandeur. The irony is that a colossus built amid the ruins of a pandemic could turn out to be a monument to the government's disregard for public good. The misplaced determination of the Centre to complete the project before the next Lok Sabha election in 2024 is characteristic of the showmanship that has befallen governance in India, but there is no justifiable urgency in razing to the ground a row of buildings and then rebuilding. Last week, 76 scholars, artists, writers, curators and museum professionals put the spotlight on a particularly concerning aspect of the project. The National Museum of India, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), and the National Archives Annexe are set to be demolished to make way for new buildings.
These experts have called for an immediate suspension of the project, and wide public consultations on the path ahead. There are valid concerns about the conservation of the collections housed at these centres. Relocation of the treasures at the National Museum, archival records at the National Archives and manuscript holdings at the IGNCA can be an extremely challenging task even during ordinary times. It is a complex operation that requires detailed planning and expertise. Such changes around premier institutions take place only after wide consultations in any part of the world; and certainly not in the opaque and cavalier manner as is being planned here. Artefacts at the National Museum still lack a complete inventory, the experts have pointed out, flagging the risk of loss or mishandling. The Central Vista redevelopment project is clearly being implemented in a hurry. The government's intolerance towards any public scrutiny of the project is such that even photography of the construction is now banned. The country is facing an unprecedented health crisis, the ripple effects of which are being felt in the economic, social and political spheres too. The government will lose nothing if it were to suspend the project, and take the Opposition and the public into confidence on the future course, in calmer times.

And to expedite the process, DUAC officials would do an initial scrutiny of the drawings before being placed before the commission, the minutes had stated.
A senior DUAC official said the Parliament project had not been brought before the commission. Commenting on the minutes that had been retracted, the official said: If a matter is brought before any organisation, it is first scrutinised. But the commission hasn't seen it yet.""

On May 11, Sadiq Khan heralded the first of a series of major art projects we've commissioned as part of our brand new #LetsDoLondon campaign"" with what he called a brilliant work by David Hockney"". But the attached doodle was manifestly slapdash, making it clear the 83-year-old artist was "" in the language of London's streets "" taking the piss"" out of his client. After much derision, Khan responded that the great thing about art is that it's a conversation starter. This piece has got people talking.""
Is that enough? Responding to my query, art historian Dr. Rupert Arrowsmith of Oxford University Press says, I offer you a line from an Ernest Hemingway poem, And in the end the age was handed / The sort of shit that it demanded . What the current age demands is not art that makes you ask questions that count, but brand names. David Hockney has basically become a brand name in the same way Calvin Klein is a brand name, and when was the last time you bought a pair of Calvin Klein underpants that were any good?""
Arrowsmith reminds me that in 2004, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917) "" a urinal jokily signed with a false name under the influence of the Dada movement "" was voted by 500 representatives of the British art world to be the most influential artwork of the 20th century, and so, in the history of art, taking the piss is actually no laughing matter. But Duchamp was doing it on purpose and Fountain is in fact a highly complex artwork embodying numerous sly observations about gallery culture and the art world. Does Hockney's work embody any sly observations?""
The contretemps about Hockney is charged with global implications far beyond London, especially after last year's global Black Lives Matter protests irrevocably recast our relationships with public art and architecture. Now, we are bound to ask: who is being memorialised and for what? What message is telegraphed?
Room for imagination
First, I think it is important for artists to question the need for an artwork in a given location,"" says artist Sudarshan Shetty. His 2012 The Flying Bus "" which whimsically endowed wings on an iconic Mumbai double-decker"" while converting its interiors into intimate gallery space "" is a masterpiece of public art that memorialises with great beauty while allowing room for the imagination to soar.
Artist Sudarshan Shetty's 2012 public art project, 'The Flying Bus' in Mumbai.
Shetty roots his argument in Indian aesthetic traditions to say that absence can speak more eloquently than superfluity: Our overly industrialised urban set-up produces a constant barrage of objects, ideas and images that are imposed upon us without respite. It's an artist's responsibility to exercise more of an erasure before adding another object into an already overcrowded realm. [We must] go back to the wisdom that comes from our own past, and find ways to re-assimilate it into contemporary life, making space for an active and meaningful engagement that is essentially democratic in nature.""
These are crucial insights for India in the 21st century, because all over the country, from the heart of New Delhi to my seaside neighbourhood of Miramar in Goa, we are witnessing the wholescale hijacking of public space by an interdependent oligarchy of corporate and political special interests. Already rampant over the past decade, the damage has increased exponentially during the COVID-19 crisis, as citizens have become distracted by more urgent exigencies of simply staying alive.
Empathy vs. opacity
Public space is not a blank, unmarked space "" it carries on its skin all the stories a society tells itself about itself,"" says poet, critic and culture theorist Ranjit Hoskote. Countries that get their public spaces right are usually those where a liberal public sphere of discussion is prized, where institutional changes are attended by public consultations."" Hoskote calls these Theory Y polities,"" which see the public space as a domain of empathy. On the other hand, he says Theory X polities"" get it wrong because opacity veils public decision-making, and a colonial-imperial distrust of the citizenry prevails. They distrust the individual, discourage dissent, and see public space as a domain to be controlled through punishment and overblown monumentalism.""
Related questions have crowded my mind since visiting Khajuraho earlier this year, where the famous temples celebrate life with sublime grace. That 1,000-year-old architecture constantly uplifted my spirit, but flying back into the thick of Mumbai's new glass-and-steel monstrosities had the opposite effect: they left me feeling helpless, squashed, short of breath.
The oft-romanticised Mumbai skyline, dotted with skyscrapers and slum tenements alike.
Most suffocating of all is Antilla, the world's most expensive home"", which is nominally private "" it's owned by Mukesh Ambani "" but expresses very public alienation. This veritable Guantanamo Bay of skyscrapers subjects the entire landscape to extraordinary rendition beneath its obliterating cowl, from which there is no escape. Antilla is all wounded feelings,"" says Professor Sarover Zaidi, who teaches at the Jindal School of Art and Architecture. A scholar of Mumbai neighbourhoods, she says, It wants to be noticed, and acts on an idea of individuation. Like most modernist architecture, it performs aspiration. The building wants to say that we are not from here. We want you to know we think we're better than you.""
On May 21, Zaidi made the case on Twitter that contemporary public architecture in India "" especially the controversial multi-billion-dollar Central Vista project in New Delhi "" has to be seen in the context of the destruction of the Babri Masjid. Speaking to me, she elaborates, 1992 changed everything structurally, socially, in every possible way. It was an extremely symbolic moment when religion came to the fore in the subcontinent in a way it hadn't since Pakistan was born in 1947. This time around, it was the first nail in the construction of Hindu India. So, while everyone is seeing the Central Vista as an attack on beauty and nostalgia, that's just a piece. You have to recognise the continuum. This is actually a moment of ideological repetition.""
Colonial fetish
In Hoskote's view, the Central Vista redevelopment  is an attack on the legacy of New Delhi and on India's epic experiment with democracy. Some observers have been tempted to compare it to Baron Haussmann's modernisation of Paris. I think this is a complete mistake. The real and only point of comparison is Albert Speer's absurd scheme to rebuild Berlin's axial vista as the symbol of a new world capital for Hitler, called Germania.""
People who support the project contend that the existing vista fetishises colonialism, but according to Hoskote, this reveals ignorance of India's architectural history. Only the National Archives building is a Lutyens design. The National Museum was designed by G.B. Deolalikar, the first Indian head of the CPWD. The IGNCA was designed by Ralph Lerner, an American architect who won an international competition in the late 1980s. The Central Vista project will actually destroy the sense of a vista, of expanse, crowding it in with buildings that "" from the projections "" seem utterly banal and undistinguished.""
Back in 1994, architect Gautam Bhatia wrote the fantastically entertaining classic, Punjabi Baroque and Other Memories of Architecture , which contains this perceptive analysis: The public is given to understand that the designated building or artistic object has little to do with its actual use but is only a medium that presents a picture of India that he wishes were true."" It seems highly relevant to what's underway in India.
Elaborating via email, Bhatia agreed that Antilla typifies what has gone wrong in India, saying it is less a statement about expressing the owner's lifestyle than a picture of the state of architecture itself. The industrial, half-baked, modernistic aesthetic "" seemingly so naturally expressed, yet so self-consciously cultivated "" is an unfortunate reminder that domesticity no longer needs to be expressed in private houses. Antilla could be an office building, a compressed mall, an airport control tower or a shoe factory. It doesn't matter. As long as it hides the living rooms, the car garages, the snow-making room, the helipads. When it is a ruin, archaeologists will have trouble carbon dating it.""
About the Central Vista, Bhatia says I don't think anyone has ever revered Nirman Bhavan or Udyog Bhavan or any of the other post-colonial structures. But they are certainly part of an important legacy of that time. No central government should be in a position to dictate what is bad architecture, what should be saved or demolished. Democratic elected governments are custodians for a short, specified time. Parents don't let the babysitter decide the course of their child's life.""
People from far and wide flock to the iconic Gateway of India in Mumbai.
Architecture for the people
There are also compelling moral dimensions. Bhatia asks, Can a poor country afford to demolish valuable construction on a whim? Even the most affluent societies are careful not to rebuild and alter without reason. The White House and the U.S. Capitol have remained externally unchanged for centuries. Only in India does a mere increase in the accommodation of MPs in Parliament become the logic to demolish and rebuild miles of public buildings on the most visible and public concourse of the city.""
In recent weeks, as the Central Vista project has advanced inexorably, Ram Rahman, the photographer and veteran cultural activist "" he co-founded the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust "" has been a prominent mourner for what is being bulldozed. His father, Habib Rahman, was an important New Delhi architect in its most intense phase of building from the early 1950s up until 1977, and was instrumental in the construction of several city landmarks.
Rahman says, There is a huge difference between Nehru's vision of public architecture and what is happening under Modi. Nehru was a democrat. When when he did not like the design of a government building, he deferred to the architects and engineers if informed that the buildings were too far in progress to make major changes. His vision gelled with the ideals of the European Modern Movement and Bauhaus "" of a modern architecture that was for the people, simple but aesthetically striking and practical.""
By contrast, he says, Modi's grand projects are classically fascist: the concreting of the Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad, which has made a section of it into a static tank. The wholesale destruction of a large swathe of Benaras to create an open vista to the Kashi Vishwanath temple. These are projects without public consultation, which override all by-laws, and physically remove people and houses to proceed.""
Rahman says, The public art and architecture being created now is wholly anti-people."" But it is also anti-artist and anti-architect, with a single-minded focus on brand identity at the cost of everything that characterises the greatness of India's built heritage from ancient times through the heady days of modernist breakthrough.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, while reserving the case for judgment in early Nov, had said the court would examine whether the project complied with land use and environmental regulations peculiar to the area which houses the Parliament and Central Secretariat buildings.
It had also indicated that it may not have to fully accept submissions made by the petitioners that there was a prohibition on building new structures.
On Dec 7, the Supreme Court had allowed the foundation stone ceremony for the new Parliament building to go ahead as scheduled on Dec 10 after the government gave an undertaking to keep in abeyance the construction or demolition of buildings and shifting of trees and wait for the verdict.

The court had, on that day, expressed displeasure with the Centre for 'aggressively' continuing with the construction, demolition and shifting of trees even as the questions concerning the legality of the project was in court.
The government has defended its multi-crore Central Vista re-development plan saying the existing building, which is nearly 100 years old, is under tremendous pressure and not a brick of the heritage structures will be touched while constructing the new Parliament, Central Secretariat and various Ministries.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the re-devleopment plan was a broad vision"". On the practical side, it would save the exchequer 1,000 crore annually and improve coordination among Ministries which would be housed in 10 buildings vantageously connected via metro rail.
The petitioners, including Rajeev Suri, represented by advocate Shikhil Suri, have objected to the proposed change in land usage of the Central Vista, the historical boulevard of approximately 3.5 km from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, and further to the National Stadium, is a symbol of India's historic past, its nationhood, its vibrant democracy.
It is where living history breathes from every inch of this cherished stretch of land, where the Republic Day parade and Beating Retreat are held every year. The Central Vista is an essential ingredient of our sovereignty and pride, and also where recreational spaces are available for the enjoyment by the citizens,"" they had contended.

The new Parliament, which is supposed to be completed by Nov 2022, should be ready in time for the Winter Session next year, according to an official. The Central Vista Avenue too would be ready ahead of its deadline in time for the Republic Day parade in 2022, the official said. The official added that though there had been some delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the backlog had been made up with additional shifts of workers being deployed. Another CPWD official said the projects were likely to be completed before the deadlines.
The revamp of the Central Vista, which stretches from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, is expected to be in full swing in 2023, when India is set to host the G-20 summit for world leaders. The last elements of the larger plan, including construction of a new convention centre and refurbishment of North and South Block to be used as the National Museum, are scheduled to be completed in 2026.
While the first two projects "" the Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue revamp "" are progressing, the CPWD has postponed the last date for bids and opening of bids for the first three Common Central Secretariat (CCS) buildings six times. The bids were to be opened on Friday, but on Thursday the CPWD cited administrative reasons"" to push the deadline to Sep 17.
Tender modified
The CPWD official said there was some mischievous"" element leading to the delays. The CPWD has modified the tender multiple times due to issues raised by potential bidders. The 3,463-crore project includes construction and five-year maintenance contract for three CCS buildings to be made on the site of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, which has been shifted to a temporary location at the erstwhile Janpath Hotel.
The Central Vista project includes the construction of a new residence for the Vice-President, for which the CPWD has invited bids, and a new residence and office for the Prime Minister, which are yet to be finalised.

As a part of the redevelopment of the Central Vista , which stretches from Rashtrapati Bhawan till India Gate and includes government offices on both sides, the proposed Vice-President's Enclave would be constructed on a 15-acre plot near North Block and Rashtrapati Bhawan, according to the CPWD's plans. Currently, the plot houses pre-Independence era hutments for Defence Ministry offices, which are being moved to two new buildings outside of the Central Vista.

Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari found no infirmity in the approvals granted by the Central Vista Committee, Delhi Urban Art Commission, the Heritage Conservation Committee and other bodies, paving the way for a new Parliament building and other edifices of government to come up. Justice Sanjiv Khanna, while agreeing with the majority opinion on the call for bid, award and the decision of the Urban Commission, dissented on the key issue of public participation in the entire exercise, which vitiated the endorsement of land use change. Governments should naturally be free to plan policies and programmes on behalf of the people, with no prior restraint, but subject to judicial review to ensure accountability. Judged against this principle, the Centre is simply exercising its privilege to plan a new set of buildings to house its establishment and the federal legislature. While the final cost estimate is unclear, planned expenditures are in excess of 13,450 crore for, among other things, a new Central Secretariat, Vice-President's enclave and Prime Minister's residence, besides 971 crore for the new Parliament. With a national consensus, such a colossal plan might be a crowning achievement for the 75th year of Independence in 2022 . What is germane to the question, however, is its appropriateness in a year of unprecedented disruption due to COVID-19 . This is when an elected government must give its undivided attention to schemes for the common weal and not be tempted into extravagant indulgence.
As Justice Khanna has pointed out, public consultation in a democracy requires citizens to be able to assess the project's rationale, armed with information on the official reasoning, and with sufficient time at their disposal. The essence of their view should inform the final decision. Opportunities for public consultation, already incorporated into modern laws and also in the Delhi Development Act, in no way fetter the executive. It would be appropriate, therefore, for the Centre to attempt consensus-building on Central Vista, without showing undue anxiety and haste in taking up all planned structures together. The pandemic's course points to uncertainty on restoration of economic health, and ameliorating the damage to large sectors of the economy, especially in services. In the run-up to 2022, the government will be tested on its ability to ensure good health for all citizens, revive normative education and provide stronger welfare. Prioritising Central Vista can prove to be a distraction from the task.

Going ahead with the project at this point of time, when the country is facing the COVID-19 pandemic , would be akin to Nero fiddling while Rome burns"", the former officials, including retired IAS, IFS, IPS and IRS officers, said.
Also read: Govt. explains the need for a new Parliament building
The letter comes as the Central Public Works Department is working on floating the tender for the construction of a new Parliament adjacent to the existing one and has received key approvals, including from the Environment Ministry and the Central Vista Committee, during the ongoing lockdown.
The group of retired officers of all-India and Central services highlighted their concerns about the impact of the redevelopment on the heritage, environment and recreational nature of the Central Vista.
This precinct is at the core of the congested capital of Delhi, and acts as the lungs of the city, with its dense mature tree canopies serving as a repository of bio diversity and the vast lawns of the Vista as a watershed for the city between the Ridge and the Yamuna. Constructing a large number of multi-storeyed office buildings, with basements, in this open area will create congestion and irreversibly change and damage the environment,"" they wrote.
Also read: Central Vista project shows govt.'s warped priorities: Congress
The group questioned the rationale behind the plan, saying that the decision was taken without any debate in Parliament. They added that while one of the premises for the proposed new Parliament building was the need to accommodate more MPs following future delimitation.
A larger parliament building to accommodate a larger number of MPs (in view of the increase in population) is itself questionable because the population is projected to decrease post 2061 as borne out by the Economic Survey indicating declining fertility rates in several States. Moreover, constructing a second Parliament building in close proximity to the existing one would diminish the existing Parliament building and might even endanger its foundations,"" the letter stated.
After stating their concerns about the project, the ex-bureaucrats questioned the timing of its implementation as well.
In the post COVID-19 scenario, when enormous funds are required for strengthening the public health system, to provide sustenance to people and to rebuild the economy, taking up a proposal to redesign the entire Central Vista at a cost of at least 20,000 crore, a figure likely to escalate significantly, seems particularly irresponsible. It seems like Nero fiddling while Rome burns,"" they wrote.
They appealed to the government to issue necessary notifications to stop the work from going ahead.

680,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-with-vision-essential-not-central-vista-project-rahul-gandhi/article34429369.ece,"A statement signed by scholars, artists and museum professionals, asking that the Government of India's Central Vista Redevelopment Plan in New Delhi be halted immediately, given the public health emergency in India on account of a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. A global community of historians and curators who work on Indian and South Asian materials, express in particular their shared concern about the planned demolition of the National Museum, the National Archives and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, and the relocation of the invaluable repositories of these key cultural institutions in a safe and responsible manner.
Here is the Statement:
We, the undersigned call for an immediate halt to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project undertaken by the Government of India, which commenced in Dec 2020. The designation of this scheme as an 'essential service' invites fresh scrutiny of the plan. It is especially troubling that this extravagant project is moving ahead in the midst of a devastating pandemic, endangering workers, and squandering scarce resources that could be used to save lives.
We would like to draw particular attention to the upcoming demolition and relocation of the National Museum of India, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), and the National Archives Annexe. In fact, preparations to raze the IGNCA complex are already underway. There was a clear logic in the urban planning of Delhi to keeping these cultural, archival and historical centres in close proximity to each other. The National Museum, in particular, has historical value and requires renovation and augmentation, not demolition. The rushed destruction of these structures will cause irrevocable harm to world-renowned institutions that have been painstakingly built over decades.
The Central Vista demolition threatens the collections of these heritage repositories. We are concerned that such a shift would impact the state of conservation of several objects. Even under normal circumstances, it would be a complex and risky operation to shift the diverse and irreplaceable treasures of the National Museum, the archival records held in the National Archives, and the manuscript holdings of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts. The current pandemic only exacerbates these risks.
The unilateral and hasty implementation of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project runs contrary to established practices worldwide. Across the globe, such plans to expand, relocate, repurpose or redesign key cultural institutions are preceded by widespread consultations and consensus building before finalizing the design, let alone moving collections indefinitely.
The details of the Central Vista demolition are opaque. It is unclear, for example, how the National Museum art objects will be stored and eventually displayed in the office complex of the North and South Blocks, as is planned. As the National Museum's collection still lacks a complete inventory of its holdings, this relocation is hazardous. The extent to which these collections will continue to be publicly accessible is also unknown.
These demolitions are only one part of a mammoth undertaking that involves constructing a lavish new Parliament and turning open space into office blocks. The project as a whole will forever alter the historic urban plan of Lutyens' Delhi, a piece of world heritage that has become an integral part of the cultural and political life of independent India.
The current escalating health crisis calls for a pause and a reset. For the short term, this project should be immediately suspended, and all priorities and resources directed to combating the pandemic. In the long term, however, this hiatus should be followed by extensive public consultations so that the future of India's institutions, heritage architecture, and historical collections can be determined through a democratic process.
We urge the Government of India to reconsider its misguided scheme.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said the change was a policy decision recommended as a part of the holistic development of the entire area. The court said the proposal was entirely a policy call and could not be said to be impermissible in law.

Dictating the order, the court said the change effected in the development plan in one sense is a matter of policy. It is not the case of the petitioner that the change has been made for mala fide reasons. Suffice to observe sufficient explanation has been provided to justify the change in use of plot number one. We find no reason to examine the matter further and want to put a quietus to the matter by dismissing the petition summarily"".
The petition had questioned the validity of a notification issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Oct 28, 2020, notifying the change in land use by proposing modification to Zonal Development Plan of Zone 'D' for plot number one in the Central Vista area of Lutyens Delhi.
Mr. Suri had argued that the proposed modification violates the right to life itself"".
The change in land use will deprive residents of Delhi and citizens of India a vast chunk of highly-treasured open and green space in the Central Vista... Right to life includes the right to enjoyment of a wholesome life,"" Mr. Suri had contended.
In Jan, the Supreme Court, in a majority verdict, had given the Government the go-ahead to the multi-crore project.
The verdict had focussed on the building of a new Parliament three times bigger than the existing 93-year-old heritage building and was concerned with the modification in the use of 86.1 acres of land home to India's power corridor.
In their majority opinion, Justices Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari had said the Government did not act against public trust. The Opposition had accused the Government of spending public money on the redevelopment project when the country was battling pandemic and unemployment with scant resources.
Justice Sanjeev Khanna, in his minority view, had opined that there should have been more public consultation involved.
The majority judgment, however, had accepted the Government's view that the project aimed for an integrated administration block"" and synergised functioning"" of Ministries at present spread across 47 buildings in the region, and in particular, Central Secretariat block.

The CPWD had in Aug invited bids for the construction and maintenance of the Vice-President's Enclave for five years, as a part of the larger Central Vista redevelopment plan. The new complex is proposed to come up near Rashtrapati Bhavan and replace the existing Vice-President's residence at Maulana Azad Road that is proposed to be demolished to make way for office buildings in the new Central Secretariat.
The government had cleared the way for the project by changing the land-use of the 15-acre plot near Rashtrapati Bhavan and North Block in Oct 2020. However, the Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to the land-use change, having adjourned the matter till Nov 16 last week.
Currently, the plot in question has pre-Independence hutments that house Ministry of Defence offices. With two new MoD buildings being completed recently, the offices are being shifted out from the hutments to make way for the construction of the V-P Enclave, according to CPWD sources.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, while reserving the case for judgment in early Nov, had said the court would examine whether the project complied with land use and environmental regulations peculiar to the area which houses the Parliament and Central Secretariat buildings.
It had also indicated that it may not have to fully accept submissions made by the petitioners that there was a prohibition on building new structures.
On Dec 7, the Supreme Court had allowed the foundation stone ceremony for the new Parliament building to go ahead as scheduled on Dec 10 after the government gave an undertaking to keep in abeyance the construction or demolition of buildings and shifting of trees and wait for the verdict.

The court had, on that day, expressed displeasure with the Centre for 'aggressively' continuing with the construction, demolition and shifting of trees even as the questions concerning the legality of the project was in court.
The government has defended its multi-crore Central Vista re-development plan saying the existing building, which is nearly 100 years old, is under tremendous pressure and not a brick of the heritage structures will be touched while constructing the new Parliament, Central Secretariat and various Ministries.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the re-devleopment plan was a broad vision"". On the practical side, it would save the exchequer 1,000 crore annually and improve coordination among Ministries which would be housed in 10 buildings vantageously connected via metro rail.
The petitioners, including Rajeev Suri, represented by advocate Shikhil Suri, have objected to the proposed change in land usage of the Central Vista, the historical boulevard of approximately 3.5 km from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, and further to the National Stadium, is a symbol of India's historic past, its nationhood, its vibrant democracy.
It is where living history breathes from every inch of this cherished stretch of land, where the Republic Day parade and Beating Retreat are held every year. The Central Vista is an essential ingredient of our sovereignty and pride, and also where recreational spaces are available for the enjoyment by the citizens,"" they had contended.

689,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/green-panel-clears-central-vista-projects/article34474301.ece?homepage=true,"Recently a short video emerged on the Internet. Apparently a presentation for the redesign of New Delhi's Central Vista by the firm of Hafeez Contractor, the video begins with a clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's voice repeating the mantra:  Ek naya Bharat banana hai (We need to build a new Bharat)!' Then a lotus morphs into a star design with bits of radiating text: 'The Largest Democracy', 'Global Icon', 'India Rising', 'New India' and 'Superpower'. From this we move into a space-age type comic-book animation. A mammoth lotus-star structure looms over the India Gate, dwarfing the old arch by about four times. Blocks of cartoon troops Mar on Rajpath, and war planes streak over this gleaming star to the sound of A.R. Rahman's Vande Mataram . A row of buildings that look like shopping malls flank Rajpath. The viewpoint constantly yo-yo's "" all missile-launchers and fighter planes. In the final shot, between the star behemoth and the half-pyramid shopping malls, India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhavan are turned into miniature structures, as if some alien race of aesthetics- mukt giants has come and occupied the capital.
Delhi over the years
The cringe-making sycophancy shown towards Mr. Modi and the ruling party, and the unbelievably crass pandering to schoolboy militarism, suggested to many people that the video was, in fact, a spoof with its tail on fire setting alight the fortress of this government's pompous self-regard. Within a few days the full horror sank in: not only was the video real, there were five others like it, and all six were actually presented by the firms shortlisted in the 'competition' to redesign the Central Vista. As with U.S. President Donald Trump, it's as though humour has been thrown out of its own building and the place occupied by black holes of power into which all possibilities of satire get sucked.
For the first quarter century of independence, New Delhi witnessed a major act of splicing and grafting: the institutions of a new country with severely limited means finding their moorings in the capital. From the early 70s onwards, the additions to institutional Delhi have had some beautiful buildings and many kaam-chalau (workable) structures in which the working day was such hell, the dark joke went, that the bureaucrats made sure to spread their misery down to the common man. Given that the last buildings to emerge from Edwin Lutyens' and Herbert Baker's plans are now almost 90 years old, there are surely many imperatives to think of upgrading or replacing the buildings near Rajpath. The big question is how this is approached.
ALSO READ
Watch | All about the project to redevelop Lutyens' Delhi
  No Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru has given much thought towards integrating modern, innovative architecture with the mundane working needs of the Central government. There could be several reasons: dearth of money leading to a justification deficit, a lack of vision and imagination, other pressing priorities. Since the 1970s, with the recently destroyed Pragati Maidan buildings and a smattering of others as exceptions, official buildings in India have lacked verve and practicality. Most administrations have let their public works departments throw concrete and steel at construction needs, leading to a proliferation of ugly, uncomfortable blocks.
There is a golden opportunity for an enlightened Central government to take the lead in creating a new philosophy of architecture and area planning. The challenges are unique to Delhi but lessons can be forged for other cities as well. The buildings of the Raj era have to be unambiguously protected as part of our heritage, built by our labourers and engineers; the best design instincts of the British architects have to be preserved and resuscitated; the aesthetics of those buildings have to be kept in mind without new designs becoming subservient. We must have the audacity to think afresh for our needs and not copy mindlessly what's been done in other countries. But first we have to ask, is it necessary at this moment to redesign the whole Rajpath area or can the needs be met with the replacing of a few of the buildings from the 70s and 80s, in addition to one or two new buildings? Care must be taken to protect the public gardens in the Central Vista, and also keep urgent ecological requirements at the heart of any new project.
Looking at the six video presentations "" Ahmedabad-based HCP Design Planning has now been chosen as the architectural consultant "" it is startling how similar they are in their glitzy grandiosity and almost complete insensitivity to what exists and what we might require. One could easily put all the plans into some kind of a random mixing programme and take the hodge-podge that emerges as the final masterplan.
Only one client
All the videos clearly address Mr. Modi as their only client. Where one video begins with a speech by Modi, another uses a photograph of Modi touching his head to the steps of the Lok Sabha. A very clear common agenda is to bury the Lutyens/Baker buildings in a mass of gargantuan structures. There is a preference for military-type 'order', with uniform buildings Maring along both sides of Rajpath. Two of the proposals have monolithic structures dwarfing India Gate; one puts the new Parliament smack in the middle of the Vista, obscuring North and South blocks; there is a huge privileging of vehicular traffic, an even more extreme blocking off of the pedestrian commons than what we've already seen, completely disregarding the fact that the area around Rajpath is one of the main open air spaces where even the poorest people can come for an outing.
A project such as this should have a considered, transparent, inclusive process, but as we know, Mr. Modi doesn't do considered or transparent, forget about inclusive. There should be diverse participation here, from urban planners and ecologists to those working on urban heritage. It should be taken into account that this will be the capital area for the foreseeable future no matter who is in power but, as we know, this regime can't imagine anyone but themselves in power. This government is only interested in using the 'completed' project as an electoral tool, wherefore the absurdly short timeline within which this massive misadventure of masonry is to be inflicted upon us. In a city already collapsing under the blows of environmental emergencies, this demonetisation of our commons will add further misery and distress.
Concretised megalomania
There should be no room in this day and age for concretised megalomania. In a nation where so many are homeless, there should no space for the Prime Minister and his close coterie to shower in these delusions of architectural glory. We are a country reeling from multiple-organ crises, economic, infrastructural, ecological, and moral. If ever there was a time for clear-eyed, unspectacular, practicable projects, it it now. This rush towards architectural self-aggrandisement yet again proves just how cut off this regime is from the needs of ordinary Indians.

692,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/central-vista-project-could-be-important-fulcrum-for-economic-revival-says-government/article32670641.ece,"Following the extensive redevelopment and radical altering of Varanasi temple precincts last year, the BJP government is now all set to reshape Central Vista in New Delhi, an urban space soaked in political symbolism and rituals. Along with it, the Parliament and Secretariat buildings will be rebuilt.
Beneath the functional reasons for this pursuit lurks the government's insatiable desire to inscribe a new political order. Criticising the project only because it overlooks the heritage value, though valid, is thin gruel. Places such as Central Vista, which hyperbolised colonial dominance, are always vulnerable to political re-inscription. The problem hence is not entirely about its remaking. It lies in the answer to the question: what purpose does it serve?
Building new capital cities or remodelling old ones can be driven by practical reasons. However, Deyan Sudjic, a British cultural commentator, cites many examples across the world to show that such projects often turn into fantasy, even a sickness."" From the Nazi rewriting of Berlin to Moscow's Red Square, the story is the same. They either harbour malevolent ambitions"" or become a naked expression of the egotism of the individual"". What is proposed in Delhi appears no different. The project neither radically undermines the spectacle of power, nor does it reconfigure the space to be more of a public space. It is an exercise in generating self-serving political symbols.
The British, who considered themselves natural heirs to the Mughals, found Delhi to be the most fitting place for a new capital. Apart from geographical reasons, the city's unparalleled historical associations appealed to them. As Robert Crewe, the Secretary of State for India (1910-11 and 1911-15) who approved the idea of shifting the capital to Delhi, said, in the eyes of the British, Delhi enshrined an imperial tradition comparable to Constantinople and Rome."" In 1911, during the Delhi Durbar, King George V announced that the government would build a new imperial city in Delhi and shift the capital from Calcutta.
New Delhi's Central Vista.
  Robert Irving's book Indian Summer (1981) extensively details the Empire's intentions behind the new city. The planners "" Lutyens, Baker, and Swinton "" conceived the city as a monumental edifice and proposed grand axial avenues and imposing buildings. King's Way or Central Vista connecting Raisina Hill and an old historic site in the east was the jewel in the crown. This ceremonial path led to Viceroy's House located on top of Raisina Hill. Viceroy Lord Hardinge, pleased with the arrangement, remarked that people would now know they were approaching the house of Lord Sahib"".
Reflecting class and race
Two secretariat buildings in front of the palace framed the vista. The All India War Memorial (India Gate), built in 1931, and a canopy that housed King George's statue after his death in 1936 accentuated the axis. The remaining offices and residences were organised around Central Vista hierarchically reflecting the inhabitants' class and race. The Council House (Parliament as it is now known) was not a separate building in the earlier design. It was after 1919, when the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms awarded select powers to self-govern, that a separate Council House was built adjacent to the Secretariat buildings and away from the principal axis.
Nehru, Gandhi, and many Indian leaders despised the entire project. They dismissed it as vulgar extravagance and considered it as conflicting with the interest of the nation.
Ironically, after independence, these leaders had no difficulty in occupying the bungalows, palaces, and Council House. The President comfortably inhabited Viceroy's House, and Indian parliamentarians and babus took over the bungalows. Ostentation and vulgar architecture posed no dilemmas. At most, the political leaders changed the names of the streets and buildings, and removed colonial statues. King's Way became Rajpath, Viceroy's House was renamed Rashtrapati Bhavan, Council House became Parliament, and King George's statue in Central Vista was removed.
In Rajpath, the Congress government found an ideal ritual space for the new republic and used it to demonstrate the country's military might through grand parades. Over time, bungalows occupied by political leaders became sacred memorials.
A cannon at the majestic Rashtrapati Bhavan gates.
A few attempts were made to recast New Delhi, but they were more about meeting commercial agendas. In 1988, conservation attempts took a serious turn, and the New Delhi area spread was designated as the Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ). The government introduced rules to regulate development. The Delhi government's dossier, submitted a few years ago to Unesco for getting the World Heritage tag, included this area along with Shahjahanabad or Old Delhi. Colonial Delhi, from a despicable site, had turned into a cherished place. History had come full circle.
It is in this context that the strident BJP government, after consecutive electoral successes, has decided to completely revamp the central area and the buildings around it. A few weeks ago, it invited consultants to participate in a contest to re-plan Central Vista, which will later serve as a blueprint for the other areas in LBZ. The government wants to complete the redesigning of Parliament by 2022, in time for the celebration of 75 years of independence. Either the existing structure will be revamped, or a new one will be built adjacent to or atop the existing one. A centralised Secretariat building will be built after the the existing ones are vacated.
The reasons given are functional, but the real intent is laid bare in the bid document: create new iconic structures that shall be a legacy for 150 to 200 years at the very least."" Conservationists are alarmed by the potential scale of changes and possible demolitions. Indian architects, for good reasons, are also upset because the contest favours hyper-sized firms known for mega projects and huge turnovers. They find the entry barriers steep and the process opaque.
Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Urban Affairs, has made it clear that the whole project is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream. This is not surprising since the pattern is now familiar: rewire the country with strident mega projects such as the Statue of Unity and Ayodhya, and incessantly generate political images.
Political spectacle
Murray Edelman, the American political scientist, who wrote extensively on political spectacles, could help us better understand what is happening. He described politics as a place composed of images and models. In such a world, politicians seek support rather than understanding and to them project outcomes matter more as symbol generation than facts. He cautions that such symbols tend to create the illusion of political solutions to complex problems, implying that one should be sceptical of the images and look beyond claims.
Joggers at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
Two examples, one from Washington and another from Berlin, demonstrate alternative possibilities. When the state becomes self-conscious about its tendency to monopolise public space, it results in modest and people-oriented outcomes.
Delhi's colonial planners, inspired by the plan for Washington, laid out Central Vista as a lush space, drawing a parallel with the National Mall. The similarity between the two stops here. While Delhi Vista remained power-intoxicated during colonial and post-colonial times, the National Mall kept up its public orientation and allowed for additions and changes that at times challenged the state's political views.
In 1791, Charles L'Enfant, the architect chosen by General Washington, designed the new capital city and laid out wide diagonal boulevards and monumental spaces befitting an aspiring country. The vast and long National Mall connecting Potomac River and Jenkin's Hill became the showpiece. However, unlike in the case of Delhi, the Mall did not focus on the presidential palace but on the Congress building (Capitol). The White House stood away from the principal axis. The Capitol too began as a relatively modest building but later expanded and acquired monumental dimensions.
Architectural historian Pamela Scott demonstrates that L'Enfant designed the Mall as a place of general resort"" and where the Goddess of Liberty reigned"". Even when the place was redesigned in 1901, the Mall did not lose its pubic orientation: libraries, museums and art galleries were lined up in front. The space had its share of memorials, but over the years transformed into one of the most popular public places.
Uncomfortable memorial
In the 1980s, it accommodated the daring Vietnam Veterans Memorial that challenged the state's version of the war. It was an uncomfortable memorial focusing on tragedy and loss and not heroics. The recent addition of the National Museum of African American History and Culture has pushed the envelope further. It differs starkly from the well-behaved buildings around and poses difficult questions to a city known for its role in the slave trade. However, in recent years, conservationists have managed to regulate changes, additions, and the use of the Mall.
In comparison, Central Vista exhibits no such impressive public gestures. Though the people of Delhi use the space, it is not yet a well-endowed public space. Neither are there any such intentions in the new scheme.
Then there is the new capital complex built after the unification of Germany. It shows how design can avoid vulgar display and embody democratic values if there is political will.
After World War II, West Germany's capital was shifted from Berlin to Bonn. And from the start, the government eschewed all architectural grandeur. The chancellor's residence (German Chancellery) epitomised modesty and the parliament settled for an unassuming building. Journalist-author Michael Z. Wise dubbed Bonn the capital of self-effacement.
Visitors lounge on the grounds of the Reichstag Building in Berlin.
To the leaders in Bonn, it was a logical thing to do since federal buildings were the laboratory of democracy"". The new Germany also did not want anything to do with its Nazi past. Architecture and city planning avoided any resemblance to the megalomaniacal plans, overpowering axis and soaring buildings of Germania designed by Albert Speer, Hitler's architect.
Sober approach
Then, in 1990, when West and East Germany unified, the government decided to shift the capital back to Berlin. Wise says that the design for the new capital complex also deliberately avoided architectural grandeur. As for the federal strip (Band des Bundes), designed by Charlotte Frank and Alex Schultes, it was also conceived as a central green strip with the Chancellery at one end and library buildings at the other, but the scale was modest, and the architecture, sleek and welcoming. Public spaces adorned the river front.
The only aberration in an otherwise sober approach was in the reuse of the Reichstag, an imposing building with a chequered history. The Reichstag Building housed the German parliament from 1894 to 1933, when it was damaged in a fire. After it was fully restored following German reunification, people had mixed views about it becoming a seat of power. But the building's designers assuaged public apprehensions by placing a glass dome on top of the Reichstag to emphasise transparency. They went a step further, allowing people to walk inside the glass dome and look at parliamentary proceedings below. It thus placed people above politicians.
The views of German architect GÃ¼nter Behnisch, the designer of the parliament building in Bonn, are worth revisiting in the present context. He believed that architecture sends distinct signals about the nature of the society in which it is designed."" In a democratic society, as he pointed out, architecture and planning projects would not be cheap but modest; self-confident but not pompous; diverse but not bombastic."" Behnisch confidently declared that when real democratic conditions prevail, democratic architecture will arise.
Will it in the BJP's Delhi?

On Oct 27, the CPWD awarded the construction and five-year maintenance contract to Larsen and Toubro Ltd. for 3,141.99 crore . This was the largest-ever contract in the CPWD history, said senior officials.
L&T was mobilising its resources and work was likely to start this month, a senior official stated. The project had a targeted timeline of 24 months for completion. The buildings are proposed to be constructed on the plot of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) campus, which has been shifted to the former Janpath Hotel temporarily. The new IGNCA campus would be built at Jamnagar House.
Bhawans' demolition
As a part of the Central Vista redevelopment, the Centre has proposed a CCS of nine office buildings and a conference centre on Rajpath to accommodate all Ministries. The existing structures on the plots, including the IGNCA, Shastri Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and the Krishi Bhawan, are proposed to be demolished to make way for the new buildings, according to the plan drawn up by the Centre's consultant, HCP Design, Planning and Management.
While inviting bids for the three buildings of the CCS, the CPWD had estimated the cost to be 3,254 crore. The tender document said the total built-up area of a building would be 4.46 lakh square metres spread over two basements, a ground floor, an upper ground floor and six storeys.
The three buildings would be constructed on the same plot, with connected basements and common boundary wall. The tender document stated that each building would be split into cores and wings. The wings would be the primary components where workplaces would be located, while the cores would have shared amenities and utilities.
When it starts, the CCS project would be the third component of the larger Central Vista revamp to be under construction, after the new Parliament building and the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue.

All these buildings have a history and to that extent, there is some nostalgia. Undoubtedly, the Foreign Secretary's room is exceptional. It is a difficult choice to make - preserving a building that may not be functional or redesigning to make it more suitable to modern use,"" he said.
North Block and South Block, with their wide corridors and layouts, were suitable for museums. Giving examples of changing uses of historic buildings, he said the Old War Office in London was now being developed into high-end apartments and the French Ministry of Finance was relocated from the Louvre in Paris to give more space to the museum.
K. Shankar Bajpai, a former ambassador and secretary in the MEA who retired in 1986, said he was very sad to hear"" about the project.
These [North and South Block] are not easy buildings to maintain and run. But they are part of our history,"" he said. While there were certain issues in working there, umpteen governments have functioned"" the same way. I don't understand why this is considered necessary,"" he stated.
The proposed Central Vista redevelopment project announced by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in 2019 includes the construction of new office buildings for all Ministries along the 3-km-long vista or Rajpath. The draft masterplan drawn up by the architects of the project, Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management, shows North and South Block being re-purposed as museums after shifting out the offices of various Ministries to the new secretariat buildings.

Saddened by Supreme court endorsement of Government 's misplaced priorities during Pandemic and clearing the Central vista project- a unnecessary and colossal waste of public money,"" Mr. Sharma said.

But the same BJP Govt imposes cuts of 37,530 CR in allowances of 113 Lakh Armed Forces & Central Govt Employees & Pensioners.PM must not forget that he has imposed cuts of 11,000 CR on 15 lakh Soldiers & 26 lakh Military Pensioners.And the same BJP Govt at Centre has no time to provide 'heated tents and equipment' to our soldiers braving brazen Chinese incursions in Ladakh,""Mr Surjewala added in another set of tweets.

Architect Bimal Patel, whose firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management, is the Central Public Works Department's design consultant for the entire Central Vista redevelopment plan that includes the new Parliament building, told The Hindu in an interview on Tuesday that the project was a complex one.
When asked if the whole project or some parts of it would be done by Nov, Mr. Patel said it had been 21 months since construction began.

For a building of this complexity and finish, 21 months is a very short time. So everybody is working hard to get it done. Let's see what happens. The ambition, aspiration and hard work are there. But it's just a very, very difficult project. Anybody in the industry will tell you that what has been achieved as of now is remarkable. If it takes a little bit more to ensure that it gets done correctly, then that is what should be and what will be,"" Mr. Patel said.
The project is being carried out by Tata Projects Limited, which started construction on the site adjacent to the existing Parliament in Jan 2021, with the estimated construction duration being 21 months. According to the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the deadline for the project was Nov this year so that the winter session of Parliament could be held in the new building.
Speaking about the design of the building, Mr. Patel said: Parliament is the most important institution of the country. It takes the diversity of our country and welds it into a nation. So we are trying to signify both the unity and diversity. The art will capture the diversity of the nation. It will try to address the complex functional needs such a building has.""

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh reserved its verdict after hearing both sides for over three hours.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, opposed the plea saying that the plea was a facade"" and a disguise"" in the form of a public interest litigation (PIL) to stall the project which they always wanted to stop.
The Solicitor General said the public interest question raised by the petitioner in the case was very selective"". He said the petitioners do not seem to care about the workmen of other construction activities going on the city.
Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, argued that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government cannot see it, then it was a sorry reflection"" of their concerns for the lives of the citizens.
Mr. Luthra referred to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather central fortress of death"", comparing it to Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War-II.
Solicitor General Mehta was displeased with the project being referred to as Auschwitz, saying one can criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court.
Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bona fide and the company was taking care of its workforce.
The company's counsel argued that the petitioners cannot decide what was the safe timeline for completing the project as it had to finish it by Nov so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.
The company also said that half of Rajpath has been dug up and if the work is stalled then the pits would be filled during the monsoon, which could lead to collapse of adjacent areas and also creation of a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases.
The High Court was hearing plea by Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, who have argued that the Central Vista project was not an essential activity and hence, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.

The intentions and motive"" behind filing of the plea are evident from the fact that the instant project has been singled out by the petitioners despite several other agencies, including Delhi Metro, carrying out construction activities across the national capital, the Centre has alleged.
The very fact that out of all these construction activities going on simultaneously for different projects by different agencies, the petitioner has chosen to be a public spirited citizen only with regard to one project only speaks volumes about his intentions and motive behind filing the present petition,"" the Centre's affidavit has contended.
Since the affidavit was not yet on record, a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh listed the matter for hearing on May 12.

In the affidavit filed in the court on May 10, the Central government has said that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted construction activities, during the prevailing curfew, where the labourers are residing on-site.
It has said the workers were engaged well before the imposition of curfew on Apr 19. It is submitted that in the meantime, a COVID compliant facility was installed at the worksite itself, to accommodate the 250 workers who had expressed their willingness to stay put and continue the aforesaid work. The facility provides for strict implementation of COVID protocol strictly and also adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour, such as sanitization, thermal screening, physical/social distancing and masking,"" the government has said in its affidavit. It has also said that the contractor has provided health insurance to all the concerned workers against COVID-19 and a separate facility for conducting the RT-PCR test, isolation and medical aid has also been set up at the site.
It is unequivocally stated that the workers working on the project as of now, are residing at the work site, following social distancing norms as well as other COVID-19 protocols. It is false to suggest that any workers are brought from Sarai Kale Khan camp to the working site on a daily basis or otherwise and consequently, the entire substratum of the case of the petitioners is erroneous and based on falsehood,"" the government has said. The High Court on May 4 had adjourned the matter to May 17 saying it first wants to study the apex court's Jan 5 judgement giving a go ahead to the Central Vista project.

Thereafter, the petitioners had moved the apex court against the high court's May 4 order, In the hearing before the apex court, they had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.
Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID-19 infection among them,"" they had told the apex court.
The apex court had declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the High Court.

The court allowed parties to file written submissions by Nov 16.
The government has defended its multi-crore re-development plan, saying the existing Parliament building, which is nearly 100 years old, is under tremendous pressure and not a brick of the heritage structures will be touched while constructing the new Parliament, Central Secretariat and various Ministries.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has argued that the re-devleopment plan was a broad vision"" and on the practical side, it would save the public exchequer 1,000 crore in annual expenditure besides improving coordination among Ministries which would be housed in 10 buildings vantageously connected via metro rail.

The official noted that the project included the challenge of construction of underpasses at a site where the water table was high, leading to flooding when the ground was dug up. The rainfall, which was the highest for a Sep in 77 years, also led to challenges for compacting the soil.
However, the officer asserted that the underpasses, eight amenity blocks, vending areas and around 10 km of walking paths would be ready before the parade.

The Sena said that even as the world is battling a second wave of COVID-19, experts have predicted that the third wave will be more severe. But the ruling BJP is doing all it can to corner Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal even today.
""A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.
BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Union minister Nitin Gadkari be given the charge of the health ministry and this is a proof that the current union health ministry has been a complete failure, it added.
India has reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the last 10 days. Globally, one out of the five active patients is in India. In the last ten days, 36,110 deaths have occurred. Every hour, there are 150 COVID-19 deaths in the country. We have left USA and Brazil behind in terms of deaths due to virus. The world fears India now, the Sena said.
According to it, several countries have stopped their citizens from travelling to India and our country is bearing the economic brunt of the pandemic.
""The country is presently surviving thanks to the development works, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of Pandit Nehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh,"" it said.
The prime minister will have to do a lot of hard work and think of non-political nationalism to help the country come out of the pandemic, it said.
On Friday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had attacked the Union government over the Central Vista project, terming it a ""criminal wastage "" and asked the dispensation to focus on people's lives.

Coronavirus","Rainfall delays Central Vista Avenue project, again - The Hindu",11,2022
709,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shiv-sena-slams-modi-government-for-central-vista-project-amid-pandemic/article34512475.ece,"There is a pattern that emerges out of the contemporary Supreme Court of India's most notable judgments. These rulings invariably begin with an homage to the ideas of the rule of law. But the opening tributes are left by the wayside when it comes time for the Court to apply those ideas to the case at hand. The invariable upshot: the executive government's caprice trumps due process, and the rule of law survives only in name. The judgment delivered on Jan 5 in Rajeev Suri v. Delhi Development Authority , in which a 2:1 majority of the Court granted its imprimatur to the proposed redevelopment of the Central Vista in the national capital, fits the trend.
Right to public participation
The majority's ruling begins in now-customary fashion. It holds that in a republic governed by the rule of law, the government's actions, howsoever laudable"" they might be, must stand the test of the Constitution. But when you read on from there, a shudder of d�j� vu soon sets in. The early paeans to the high principles of democratic values"" are enfeebled by the Court's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a right to public participation, a right, which ought to be seen as fundamental in a democracy, properly understood. What is more, a repudiation of basic environmental norms is condoned, because, according to the Court, the principle of sustainable development and precautionary principle need to be understood in a proper context"", one in which competing public interests"" must be harmonised and balanced. As we know only too well, every time the Court uses the language of harmony and balance, development eclipses every other concern.
Comment | Beyond the Central Vista verdict, key questions
A state-people link
Delhi's Central Vista, originally conceived by Edwin Lutyens, stretches from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Littered with sprawling parks and lawns, it houses not only an ensemble of landmark government buildings "" from Parliament House to the Secretariats on the North and South Block "" but also a number of other important public structures: among others, the National Archives of India, the National Museum and the National War Memorial. Its open spaces and the easy physical access that it affords to seats of power also mean that it has served in many ways as a link between the state and its people.
In 2009, the Central Vista was considered important enough to be designated, after extensive public consultation, as a Grade-I heritage precinct. This meant that any development inside the area had to be regulated and controlled"" in a manner that would leave its grandeur unscathed. But the proposal today, which portends enormous costs, is not any simple act of development within the boundaries of the area.
Instead, it seeks to remake the space. A new Parliament house will be erected next to the existing heritage building "" it has been suggested, the central hall, where Nehru made his Tryst with Destiny"" speech, where the Constitution was adopted, would be converted into a museum of democracy"". A new secretariat and a new residence for the Prime Minister will be built, and a number of post-Independence buildings, including the National Museum, will be taken down.
Central Vista | Beyond the veils of secrecy, the project is both the cause and effect of its own multiple failures
Petitions and claims
Petitions originally filed in the Delhi High Court, and transferred later to the Supreme Court, alleged that the government had failed to follow due process in approving the project. Two claims stand out: first, that the state had sanctioned an alteration to the existing land use permitted under law without sufficient public consultation; second, that the environmental clearance for the project is unreasoned, and was, in any event, obtained by illegitimately carving the project into two.
In his judgment for the majority, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, writing on behalf of himself and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, holds that the project required no special judicial scrutiny. According to the Court, the petitioners' case was not predicated on the violation of any fundamental right, but only on the rigours prescribed by statute, in this case, the Delhi Development Act, 1957. That law, though, as Justice Sanjiv Khanna's dissenting opinion notes, does, in fact, mandate, among other things, the granting of an opportunity to the public to place on record its objections, and for those objections to be considered by hearing the objectors.
Editorial |  Building by accord: On Central Vista
Here, although objections were invited from the public, a mere three-days' notice was given for the hearing on those complaints. The majority rules that the law does not make personal hearings mandatory, and, therefore, it was irrelevant whether sufficient time was granted or not. There are, at least, two problems with this finding: one, the Court has consistently held in the past that arbitrary state action violates fundamental rights, in particular the equality clause of Article 14. This would mean that in a project such as this, where a transformational change is brought about to the Master Plan framed under the 1957 Act, the public ought to have been accorded a sufficient chance to place on record all its objections, and a sufficient chance to be heard personally on those complaints.
Two, any civic participation can be productive only if complete information is placed in the public domain. In this case, the Board of Enquiry and Hearing (BoEH) which was appointed to consider the objections raised on the change in the land use, recognised the merit in the objectors' plea that the full details of the project were not made available. Among the respondents, majority of whom are Planners/Architects, there appears to be a feeling that authentic technical information on this iconic project of Central Vista is not available in public domain, which is leading to avoidable misgivings....,"" its report noted. Moreover, it also recommended that impact assessment studies on traffic, environment and heritage"" ought to be commissioned at the earliest. But despite these findings the Delhi Development Authority sanctioned the proposal.
Central Vista |  Govt has ignored objections to redevelopment: Justice Sanjiv Khanna
Need for adequate disclosures
According to the majority, it was sufficient that the authority had the power to do so. The absence of a reasoned order overriding the BoEH's specific concerns was found to be of no value. As a result, the Court had effectively determined that the Constitution guarantees no independent right to public participation. But, as the dissenting judgment shows us, the most basic principles of procedural fairness "" doctrines that flow from an array of constitutional promises "" require the state to make adequate and intelligible disclosures. This is especially so in this case, because, as Justice Khanna identifies, the project, when executed, will have permanent and irreversible consequences.
Central Vista |  Government entitled to commit errors, says Supreme Court
Environmental scrutiny
The nature of the project ought to have also led to a more careful scrutiny on the environmental clearance granted to it by the Expert Appraisal Committee. Clearance had been sought not for the redevelopment of the Central Vista but only for the construction of a new Parliament building. This meant that the application was considered simply as a Building and Construction Project"" rather than as a Township and Area Development Project"", which would have enhanced the level of inspection. Again, as the dissent observes, the Expert Appraisal Committee's order granting sanction does not so much as render a finding on why the project was sliced into two.
Central Vista |  Estimated cost, without PMO, goes up to 13,450 crore
These concerns over procedure, and over the denial of adequate public participation, might not strike us intuitively as matters of grave importance. But if the rule of law must mean something, we must regard the basic goals of our constitutional tradition with respect. That tradition, more than anything else, requires decisions made by the state to be just, fair and reasonable, both in its substance, and, however tedious it might be, in its adherence to procedure.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh remarked that there was no reason for for the court to suspend the construction activities as the workers were staying at the project site, and COVID-19 protocols are adhered to and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is being followed"".
We are of the view that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners and not a genuine public interest litigation [PIL],"" the court said while imposing a cost of 1 lakh on petitioners Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator; and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film maker.
'Not an essential activity'
They argued that the project was not an essential activity and hence, it could be put on hold for now during the pandemic.
The court noted that the work at the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment was part and parcel of the Central Vista Project and of vital public importance and the legality of the project had been upheld by Supreme Court.
By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that Central Vista Project or Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project is not an essential project,"" the court said, adding, If this type of project is stopped by the court, the main project cannot be completed within the stipulated time"".
It noted that the work at the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project had to be completed by Nov, 2021.
While the petitioners argued that the time limit be extended, the court said, Such kind of arguments cannot be accepted by this court, keeping in view that the construction activity of this essential project or of a project of national importance cannot be stopped especially when the conditions imposed by the order of the DDMA dated 19th Apr, 2021...are not flouted or violated"".
The Central Vista Project includes Parliament, refurbishment of North Block, South Block, construction of new offices for Central government - Common Central Secretariat, Central Conference facilities, and Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project (both sides of the Rajpath where Republic Day celebrations are held every year).
The High Court remarked that several other agencies such as the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), DMRC (Delhi Metro), Public Works Department (PWD), and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) were undertaking construction projects in the Delhi.
It is obvious that petitioners have selectively chosen only one project which is of national importance, at a vital place where Republic Day celebrations are held in Delhi and is a part and parcel of the larger project, namely, Central Vista Project,"" it stated.
The Centre had opposed the plea saying that it was a fa�ade"" and a disguise"" in the form of a PIL petition to stall the project, which they always wanted to stop.
'Very selective'
Solicitor General Tushar Mehra had argued that the public interest question raised by the petitioner in the case was very selective"".
Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, for the petitioners, had stated that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government could not see it, then it was a sorry reflection"" of their concern for the lives of the citizens.
Mr. Luthra had referred to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather central fortress of death"", comparing it to Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II.
Mr. Mehta had expressed displeasure with the comparison, saying one could criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court.

713,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/weekend-at-kartavya-path-brings-back-pre-covid-cheer/article65880561.ece,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the groundwork for the Central Vista project even as the Centre said there was no overreaching of the court process in the pursuit of the 20,000-crore redevelopment plan of the nation's power corridor clearances.
Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, advocate Shikhil Suri, for petitioner Rajiv Suri, said the government was churning out approvals"" for the project regardless of pendency of challenge in the top court.
Can we restrain authorities from acting as per law?"" Justice Khanwilkar, flanked by Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, asked Mr. Suri.
Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for another petitioner, said clearances were being sought and obtained continuously.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government, said a consolidated reply to the allegations would be filed. The court asked the government to file its reply by Jul 3. It posted the case for hearing after Jul 6, when the court re-opens post vacations. The court is closing for a two-week vacation on Jun 19.
The petitions have primarily challenged a notification issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Mar 20 authorising the change of land use.
On Mar 6, the top court transferred the issue from the Delhi High Court and ordered that any steps taken by the authorities, in the meantime, will be subject to the outcome of the proceedings"".
Mr. Mehta countered why the petitioner has a problem as the project envisaged only the construction of Parliament.
Mr. Suri has argued that the proposed change in land usage of Central Vista, the historical boulevard of approximately 3.5 km from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, and further to the National Stadium, is a symbol of India's historic past, nationhood and vibrant democracy.
It is where living history breathes from every inch of this cherished stretch of land, where the Republic Day parade and Beating Retreat are held every year. Central Vista is an essential ingredient of our sovereignty and pride, and also where recreational spaces are available for the enjoyment by the citizens. It is a major attraction for the tourists who visit the country,"" the petition has said.
The petition reminded that Article 49 of the Constitution provided for protection of monuments and places and objects of national importance.
In the 're-development' of the Central Vista, the entire matter has been clothed in secrecy and opacity. More sinister are the murky, dubious and suspicious events, leading up to the present-day events. Foremost is the malevolent and malicious manner in which Central Government decided in May 2015 to withdraw India's nomination to attain a World Heritage City tag for Delhi's Imperial Capital Cities from UNESCO; a quest it had been pursuing over the last decade or so. A dossier meticulously and painstakingly created over the previous five years and placed before UNESCO's World Heritage Committee was abruptly withdrawn a month before a final decision was to be taken by UNESCO, without any reasons being assigned by the Government,"" the petition said.

Congress MP Anand Sharma had asked the government the reason for the proposed redevelopment of the three-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, and the construction of a new Parliament building and a common Central Secretariat, which was announced in Oct last year. He also sought to know the total expenditure of the project.
Responding to the question on Mar 4, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri informed the Rajya Sabha that the construction of the Parliament building began in 1921 and it was commissioned in 1927. Over the years, the parliamentary activities and the number of people working therein and visitors have increased manifold. Hence, the building is showing signs of distress and over utilization. Further, with the reorganization of constituencies, the number of Lok Sabha seats is likely to go up and the present building does not have any space to house any additional member,"" the Minister's reply read.
He added that the additional office space in the newly constructed Parliament Annexe and library building was insufficient to meet the requirements"".

The Minister's response comes at a time when the Central Public Works Department has filed for environmental clearance and change of land-use for the project, which is facing legal challenges. The Delhi High Court on Mar 6 transferred the cases related to the Central Vista project to the Supreme Court.
Apart from constructing a new Parliament adjacent to the existing one, the government is also working on developing a common Central Secretariat for all Ministries along the Central Vista. Currently, the Ministries are spread over 47 buildings, the Minister said, adding that there was a shortfall of 3.8 lakh sq m of office space. He said the expenditure on the project would be worked out once the drawings for the buildings were finalised.
However, in its application for environment clearance on Feb 12, the CPWD had said that the project's proposed cost would be 776 crore.
In his reply, the Minister said the existing Parliament building would be used for other activities after it is structurally rehabilitated and renovated"".
Experts, however, have questioned the lack of assessment of the project's potential impact. The chairperson of the Indian Institute of Architects, Northern chapter, Shamit Manchanda, said there were non-destructive testing methods, including using ultrasonic waves, to assess a building's structural stability.
We are not saying that the government should not carry out the project, it's their prerogative, but they should carry out the assessments, including of the project's environmental impact. It seems that they have a proposal and now they are trying to justify it,"" he said.

In the current version of the plan, which is yet to be finalised, HCP director Bimal Patel said a 15-acre plot at Jamnagar House where hutments stand today had been identified to relocate IGNCA. Whether or not the national centre for arts that comes up at the site will bear the former Prime Minister's name, remains to be seen.
As a part of the ambitious plan, being executed through the Central Public Works Department of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, a new Parliament building near the existing circular heritage structure has been proposed. Mr. Patel said the triangular building will have a Lok Sabha chamber big enough to accommodate 900 MPs usually, in view of any future increase in the number of seats, and up to about 1,300 for a joint session of Parliament. Two MPs would share one 1,300 mm bench, which would be enough to accommodate a third MP during a joint session, he said.
The triangular building would have a spire, though the material it would be made of was yet to be decided. Speaking of the original architects of New Delhi, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, Mr. Patel said the idea wasn't to mimic the existing Parliament, but have the new and old buildings work together.
The Prime Minister's residence was proposed to be shifted to a plot south of South Block, while the new PMO would be opposite DRDO Bhawan, giving the PM the option of walking to work and back, he said. The North and South Block, may be converted into museums of Indian history, while the Ministries located there currently, would be shifted to the 10 office buildings along Central Vista, according to the current plan. The Vice-President's residence would be shifted to a plot near North Block that currently has hutments.
The 10 new buildings will be seven-storied, with stone on the outer fa�ade, with glass and steel facing the inner courtyards. These would be connected to the Metro stations in the area through underground shuttles, he said. These buildings would bring all Central government Ministries in one area.
The original National Archives building would remain the same, but the additions to the plot over the years would be removed, he said.A central conference facility would be constructed next to the archives.
The Central Vista Avenue will be spruced up, with better landscaping and public facilities. Taking forward Lutyens' idea of ridge to river"", a New India Gardens"" would be created near the Yamuna. A design competition would be held for the installation to commemorate 75 years of India's Independence at these gardens.
Lastly, a 48-acre space along Mother Teresa Crescent would be used to house a biodiversity arboretum, where endangered plant species would be preserved in glass houses.
According to sources, this plan has been evolving since Oct, when HCP was awarded the contract by CPWD. Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep S Puri has said earlier that the tenders for the individual projects within the larger revamp would be floated by May. The deadlines for the new Parliament and common Central Secretariat are 2022 and 2024 respectively.

Most of these are violations of the dust control rules of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that are supposed to be followed at all construction sites, to avoid the dangerous particulate matter (PM) emanating from construction waste causing respiratory ailments to people.
From Mansingh Road towards Akbar Road, heaps of uncovered earth could be seen lying on pavements. Pavements next to green metal sheets, which formed the boundary of the redevelopment work, were broken at many places, exposing the soil. Towards the left, beyond the green metal sheets where work was happening, one could clearly see heaps of soil and demolition waste.
As per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules 2016, every waste generator should keep the construction and demolition waste within the premise and ensure that there is no littering of the waste preventing obstruction to traffic, public or drains. 
Also, those carrying out such construction are to be held prima-facie be responsible"" for collection, segregation of concrete, soil, and other waste, and for storage of construction and demolition waste generated, as per rules.
When contacted, the spokesperson of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), under which the redevelopment work is happening, said he has forwarded the issue to the officials concerned. 
At the intersection of Janpath and Rajpath, grey-colour construction sand was dumped on the pavement without it being covered. 
As per the CPCB guidelines for dust control issued in Nov 2017, based on the 2016 rules, sheets made of plastic, tarpaulin etc. should be used to cover construction material that is easily airborne and also for the debris that is dumped at temporary storage sites.
The CPCB had in its 2017 guidelines identified, along with photos, problems similar to the ones seen around central vista redevelopment.
Where the buck stops
After seeing photos from the area, Polash Mukerjee, Lead for Air pollution at the India programme of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said that it appears to be a clear violation"" of rules.
Compliance with dust pollution rules has increased in the past four to five years in Delhi-NCR, but it's still not 100%. In this case, it is less maybe because it's a high-level project,"" he said.
Mr. Mukerjee said that in many countries abroad, the onus of proving that you are following pollution control norms at construction sites is on the contractor or the project owner, but in India it lies on the government.
Giving examples of best practices followed by other countries, Mr. Mukherjee added, In California, the contractor has to install localised air pollution monitoring sensors at the construction site to measure pollution levels. This helps to keep a check on dust pollution.""

The letter was not based on facts and some of them needed to have their head examined before signing it, he stated at a press conference.
The letter, addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Urban Development Minister, said: This project began, if reports are to be believed, because of a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is 'unlucky', as well as with the thought of leaving a particular government and its leader's impression on the architecture of Delhi...""
Terming them educated fools, Mr. Puri said any civil servant with about 40 years of experience would not rely on reports that needed to be believed"". Without naming one signatory, he said the retired official was Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India when the plan to have a new Parliament building started taking shape in 2012.
It was in 2012 that the OSD (officer on special duty) to the then Lok Sabha Speaker, Meira Kumar, had written to the Urban Development Ministry about it. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had also written an article on the issue. And now in 2021 it is said that the new Parliament is being constructed because of a superstitious belief ?,"" he said. He did not receive the letter that had been circulating in social media, he asserted.
Also read: PIL against Central Vista construction another attempt to stall project: Centre to HC
The new building was being constructed as the present one was cramped. As the freeze on parliamentary seats and seat allocations to States would be lifted in 2026, the number of members in both the two Houses would increase, he noted.
There was an element of mischief and wishful thinking (of those opposing the project). When they saw that the Supreme Court cleared it, they went to the Delhi High Court where also the government had now got the clearance and a cost of 1 lakh was imposed on the petitioner, he said.
HC ruling
On Monday, the High Court ruled that the petition was motivated . It said the national project was vital and essential.
The Minister said that people would remember how during the crisis, Opposition leaders initially fuelled vaccine hesitancy, targeted domestic manufacturers and then demanded that everyone be vaccinated. Whose side you are on,"" he asked. Wondering on what basis the two domestic manufacturers were criticised, he said he at times thought that it was all an attempt to make the country dependent on foreign manufacturers.
Refuting a media report, which suggested that the construction work for the Prime Minister's residence was likely to start in Aug, Mr. Puri said its conceptual designs had not yet been presented to the Ministry.
'False narrative'
Over the past several months, a false narrative was being built, he alleged. He disputed the purported project cost of 20,000 crore being quoted to target the government, stating that currently the focus was on just two of the sub-projects: the new parliament building and Central Vista avenue, involving a total estimated expense of about 1,300 crore.
The Minister said that about 900 of the 1,300 workers deployed at the construction sites had been vaccinated so far and COVID-19 related protocols were being adhered to strictly.

The DDA had on Dec 21, 2019 issued a notification seeking objections and suggestions for the proposed land use change for eight plots, including for the construction of a new Parliament building and residences, meant for the Vice-President and the Prime Minister.
In its Jan 18 letter to the DDA by IIA Northern chapter chairperson Shamit Manchanda, the IIA said there would be a loss of at least 80 acres [32 hectares]"" currently earmarked, directly or indirectly, for general public use in the master plan.
One plot of 15 acres currently earmarked for bus terminal/parking/recreational use has been proposed to be changed to government office"".

The IIA added that recreational space of 20 acres would be lost, while only 3.76 acres would be added.
Further, the notice provides no details of compensatory allocation of land to recreational/public/semi-public land use for which reason it is surmised that no such provision is made,"" the letter said.
Violation of master plan
The IIA also flagged what they called a violation of the master plan with regard to the decentralisation of offices.
As per NCR plan, no new Central government and Public Sector Undertaking offices should be located in NCTD. However, the issue of shifting existing government / PSU offices from Delhi as well as restricting the setting up of new offices would only be possible after a time-bound action plan is prepared together with suitable incentives and disincentives,"" the IIA quoted the master plan.
The IIA added: It is clear in the policy document that no new Central government offices should be located in NCT of Delhi.""
Suggestions
Giving suggestions, the IIA said: In view of the points mentioned above, it is requested that the details sought are made public before proceeding with the proposed land use changes that seem to be conflicting with the Master Plan of Delhi  2021.""
The IIA also asked if any study had been done to assess the impact of the additional pedestrian and vehicular traffic that the land use change would cause.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the power corridor of the country  includes the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. It also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a Common Central Secretariat and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.
Responding to a question in Lok Sabha on the relocation of trees to the Badarpur Eco-Park, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said according to information received from the Central Public Works Department, ""only 22 number of trees have been relocated from the Central Vista Avenue to the eco-park, Badarpur, and there is no other proposal to relocate trees from the Central Vista Avenue to Badarpur"".

He said there is a proposal to plant 10 saplings for every tree uprooted or removed, and the compensatory plantation will be done at the Badarpur Eco-Park, Badarpur.
On another query on census of trees, Mr. Yadav said, ""As per available information, no tree census has been conducted in the recent past."" ""However, the Forest Survey of India (FSI) carries out sample plot based regular inventory of trees in forests and outside forests in the country under its National Forest Inventory Programme,"" he said.
On the basis of data collected growing stock  stems and volume of wood  estimates are generated at the national and state levels, he told Lok Sabha in a written response.
To a question about the survival rates of relocated trees and details of existing and ongoing research that supports relocation, Mr. Yadav said the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun, had conducted a study on tree translocation in India last year and it has submitted a report to the ministry.
""There is no further ongoing study under the ICFRE at present in this regard,"" he said.
The Centre had earlier rubbished reports that several jamun trees, nearly 100 years old, could be uprooted as a part of the Central Vista project, and had claimed that the overall green cover will increase.
In May, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had said that only a few trees will be transplanted as part of the project.
The environment ministry has already granted clearance for expansion and renovation of the existing Parliament building, which is a part of the  13,450 crore Central Vista redevelopment project .
The construction of the prime minister's residence under the ambitious project will be completed by Dec 2022, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had informed a central government appointed expert panel, which has given its nod to the project.
The CPWD, the project developer, informed the expert appraisal committee (EAC) that the expansion of Parliament building and construction of new Parliament building will be done by Nov 2022 and prime minister's residence will be constructed by Dec 2022.

The total number of trees in the area, which previously stood at 3,890, has been increased to 4,087 while storm water drains have been introduced along with granite pathways, according to the Ministry.

Pending work
The pending work includes a step-based garden set-up, eight amenity blocks and four underpasses for pedestrians, which is currently in progress.

Following changes in the land use by the urban body for the proposed modification of the Central Vista, the DDA had invited the public to register their objections and suggestions.
Those with objections to the proposed plans said that there seemed to be a mad rush"" to implement the plans for the new Central Vista without a multi-layered consultation"" and that it would not help decongest the city.
Architect Swanzal Kak Kapoor, one of those to forward objections to the DDA said, The primary objection is that the plan deviates from the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 and this cannot happen overnight. There needs to be expert consultation from various fields and cannot happen through internal government decisions. At a time when green spaces are needed desperately, you cannot possibly take away public spaces like this.""
Adding that felling of full grown trees is also likely to take place due to the project, Ms. Kapoor said, A three-level basement has been proposed. If that happens, there will be no land left for new trees to grow. The real concern is that what will be lost cannot be replaced.""
Environmentalist Chetan Aggarwal who had also forwarded his objections to the DDA said, Apart from the massive felling of trees which will take place, the other concern is that institutions like the National Archives, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) and others are meant for the public. Converting these into office spaces would mean that spaces meant for public will shrink.""
Stating that the MPD-2021 entails decongesting the Capital, Anil Sood who attended the public hearing said, You cannot change the land use based only on photos and not a proper blueprint. The MPD-2021 talks of decongesting the city but the same DDA is changing the land use to multiply congestion.""
Ms. Kapoor added, It took two years for the IGNCA to be designed. How can the plan for something like the Central Vista be finalised within three weeks? The government has every right to make changes but the revisualisation cannot be done by 3-4 people only.""

According to Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry officials on Saturday, the new look of the 2-km Central Vista Avenue, which stretches from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, was likely to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sep 8, after which it would be open to public the next day.
The redevelopment of the popular public space in the heart of the Capital started after the Republic Day parade in 2021 and was supposed to be completed by Nov last year. Though it missed the deadline, Rajpath was readied for the parade on Jan 26 this year. After the parade, the work resumed, while Rajpath remained closed for the public.
Among the additions to the area would be five vending zones behind the India Gate lawns with space for 40 vendors each, which would include a few ice cream carts, according to a senior official. Earlier, the ice-cream carts, toy-sellers and other street food vendors would be lined up along Rajpath. In addition, two zones on either side of India Gate would have eight stalls each. These, sources familiar with the development, said would have street food from 16 states, which were being selected by Delhi Tourism. A source said Delhi Tourism was trying to have a few of these stalls ready for the inauguration, with the rest being opened later.

Picnics would not be allowed on the lawns in the stretch from India Gate until Mansingh Road, while areas behind the lawns had been opened to the public with addition of 16 permanent bridges over the canals, officials said. Eight amenity blocks with toilets, kiosks and drinking water as well as parking lots for a total of 1,100 vehicles would be available in the spaces beyond the canals. Boating would be allowed in the two canals behind Krishi Bhawan and Vanjiya Bhawan, an official said.
The first month after the reopening would see heavy police presence in view of the anticipated large numbers of visitors, the senior official said. Around 50 security guards, 300 CCTV cameras and a control room for the police would also be in place, the official said.

Even though, we got rid of colonialism in 1947 after decades of anti-imperial struggle, most remnants of the colonial era were dispensed with, and rightly so.

But, I must say that in the context of Queen Elizabeth's passing we officially declared 11 September as the day of mourning, we left behind our obsession for a change. However, we also know that she always remained indifferent to the demands of apology on colonial atrocities. We do hear voices of discomfort from several African countries, they still do not want to overlook the repression of the colonial past.

However, the recent Central Vista project rekindled our selective engagement, yet again. One of the key roads that began from the Rashtrapati Bhavan- Rajpath was known as Kingsway during the colonial times whereas the Queensway got later renamed as Janpath. Here, the word 'Raj' was used for governance as the road began from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, flanked by the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building and not really to indicate the British Raj.

However, we saw loud and misplaced claims that renaming it as 'Kartavya Path' is a break from the colonial past.

CCS will have office space for 51 ministries. Three CCS buildings are under construction after the demolition of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.

According to the government's Central Vista project website, the office buildings will have a capacity to 'hold about 54,000 personnel'. The offices are proposed to be connected through a loop of an automated underground people mover, overground shuttles, and walkways.

Three Central Vista projects, including the New Parliament building and the vice-president's enclave, are under construction. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the redeveloped Central Vista Avenue.

The 200m subterranean tunnel will cost 21.3 crore. The development of the 206 crore Vice President's Enclave started earlier this year and is expected to be ready by January. The Union housing and urban affairs ministry informed the Lok Sabha in August that the construction work was 24% complete.

It will be later joined to the tunnel proposed to connect it to the new Parliament building and PM's new residence. The plan is yet to be finalised,' a CPWD official said, seeking anonymity.

To be sure, the plan for the tunnel connecting the three locations is yet to be finalised.

The new Prime Minister's residential complex, to be built at a cost of 360 crore, will have a two- storeyed building as residence, another building for the Prime Minister's home office, guest house, and an office for the Special Protection Group, quarters for support staff, CPWD office and a basement parking lot, among others. Spread over 15 acres, it will have four entry and exit gates and 25 watchtowers.

The pre-qualification bids for the Prime Minister's residential complex will be opened on October 14, according to the tender document. Construction companies shortlisted in the pre-qualification process will be allowed to participate in the financial bids.

The construction of the complex will be completed within 21 months from the award of work. The construction company that will be awarded the work will have to plan for tree transplantation and shifting of utilities.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is the nodal agency for the project, said over 350 people are deployed to keep the area clean.

What is becoming a big problem for the sanitation staff is cleaning the betel stains off the walls and pavements. The security guards and sanitation workers say it is difficult to stop people from spitting.

'There are betel stains on the walls of the pedestrian underpasses and pavements. It is difficult to clear the stains from the Kota stone on the walls or the Lakha granite used on the pavements. Every evening, we use scrubber machines and special chemicals to remove the stains,' said a supervisor of sanitation workers.

A senior CPWD official said, 'The footfall at the avenue has increased manifold. Close to a 100,000 people visit during the weekends and because of the high footfall, keeping the area clean is a major challenge.'

Traffic and lack of parking

Due to the high footfall, traffic management has also become a concern. Traffic officials said paucity of parking facilities was affecting traffic flow. Though there are six parking lots at the venue with space to accommodate 1,100 plus vehicles and 40 buses, only four are currently operational.

The CPWD official quoted above said, 'We have handed over four parking lots to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) with space to park 800 vehicles and 35 buses.'

A senior traffic police officer, who did not want to be named, said the parking space crunch was hampering the traffic flow around the India Gate C-Hexagon and on its radial roads, especially during rush hour and on weekends when a large number of people visit the Central Vista Avenue.

'The number of vehicles coming to Central Vista Avenue is a lot more now, especially on weekends and holidays. Of the four parking spaces, people mostly try for the two lots at the C-Hexagon-Man Singh Road and that leads to jams on the India Gate Circle,' the officer said.

On being asked why the gates of the two parking lots at C-Hexagon were closed by the police, the officer said that is done whenever there is a huge crowd. 'Movement of vehicles is badly affected on the C-Hexagon when motorists try to use the enter/exit of parking slots number 1 and 2.So we ensure that the two lots are accessed only from Man Singh Road, where traffic volume is low,' the officer added.

A senior police officer said barricades installed in front of the entrance at India Gate will not be removed any soon for security reasons; however barricades around the area will be removed in a phased manner. 'We have spoken to CPWD and the barricades will be removed once grilles are installed at intersections. The barricades are currently installed to curtail jaywalking,' the officer said.

Street vendors struggle to get licence

Street vendors say they are yet to get permission from the NDMC to hawk their trade at Central Vista. While 90 ice-cream trolley vendors have been given permission, though not on Kartavya Path, food vendors have not been allowed as yet. The National Street Vendors Association of India (NASVI) has written to the NDMC to allow street vendors, who were among those surveyed in 2007, to hawk their wares at Central Vista Avenue.

Arbind Singh, national coordinator, NASVI, said, 'There are several street vendors who have not been given the permission even after a month. These people were among the vendors surveyed in 2007 and have been working in this area for decades. We have written to NDMC and even to the MOHUA to look into the matter.'

Gulab Singh, who has been selling ice candies at India Gate for nearly two decades, said, 'There are 62 vendors who have not been given the licence to vend until now. The NDMC has allowed company-owned ice-cream trolleys, but what about us?'

NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay said, 'There is no plan to increase the number of general vendors at this time.'

Upadhyay said the NDMC is finalising the request for proposal to hire a private operator to manage the parking sites. 'For the time being, NDMC officials will continue to manage the parking sites. In the coming weeks, we will operationalise all six parking lots,' he said.

NDMC has also launched a drive to prevent illegal hawking, defacement and encroachments on the avenue with fines ranging from 50 to 2,000. 'So far, the health department has issued more than 590 fines for littering,' an official from the health department said.","A month after Central Vista opened, paan stains, parking a headache for CPWD | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times",10,2022

It is planning to hire a firm for the purpose and for synergy among stakeholders for the successful completion of the project.

As part of the 13,500-crore Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the CPWD, the Centre's construction arm, has started construction work on the new Parliament, three buildings of the common central secretariat, and Vice President's Enclave.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the redeveloped Central Vista Avenue, which missed several deadlines, in September. The new Parliament is to be completed by November. It is unlikely to be ready before Parliament's winter session though work is going at a fast pace.

The three secretariat buildings are to be completed by December 2023. The enclave is likely to miss the January 2023 deadline, a CPWD official said. Till August, the enclave was 24% complete, Union minister Kaushal Kishore told Lok Sabha that month.

Work for another secretariat building and Members of Parliament chambers is likely to be tendered soon.

CPWD officials said technical assistance is required to monitor the projects. They added a need was felt that one project support unit was needed to be engaged to assist in the monitoring of the projects and peer review of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services.

The unit will assist in preparing the work breakdown structure covering all design, engineering, procurement, and construction activities. It will also assist in preparing the baseline schedule after consulting all the stakeholders including CPWD, consultants, contractors, etc.

For projects in the planning stages, suggestions will be sought for energy-saving measures, standardisation of light fixtures and furniture, selection of materials for the facade, and cost analysis for various options of materials. The unit will prepare weekly and monthly progress reports on key activities and milestones after physical inspection.",Central Vista Redevelopment: CPWD to seek assistance to track progress | Latest News India - Hindustan Times,11,2022

India Gate and the popular public spaces around it donned festive attire for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, even though the area was, for much of the evening, cordoned off for members of the public. It was thrown open after 8.45pm, when the inauguration ceremony came to a close.

Still, a few hundred visitors were present to view the event outside on large LED screens installed at Rafi Marg and Man Singh road.

While some looked for a flashy new backdrop for their social media posts, others who reached, said they wanted to be a part of history.

MS Bellubbi, a visitor from Karnataka's Vijaypura district said he was in the city for personal work but did not want to miss the historic occasion.

'These things happen once in a lifetime. I have been to Delhi five times earlier and this is the first place people from other states come to see. It looks much better now,' he said.

With the Prime Minister reaching the venue around 7pm on Thursday, a series of selfies followed in front of the LED screens, with India Gate in the backdrop, illuminated with the Tricolour and lasers beaming into the sky.

All major buildings around Central Vista were equally decked up to match the occasion, with bright lights and the Tricolour the common themes.

'I have been coming to India Gate frequently, but this was an occasion that could not be missed. I intend to capture the entire occasion on video, which will form a part of my vlog, which showcases different flavours of Delhi,' said Shehnaaz Alvi, who hails from Sonipat but has been working in Delhi as a school teacher.

A host of people also made their way to the Netaji statue after the inauguration to take photographs. A short clip of Netaji's contribution to the freedom movement was played at the event.

Anand Mukherjee, a member of the Netaji Subhas INA Trust, said, 'It is an important moment for us. He has been neglected by successive governments. This government has played an important role in recognising his contribution.'

The area around the statue was decorated with large-scale paintings by schoolchildren on Netaji. The Prime Minister got a glimpse of the cultural events that have been planned along Kartavya Path as part of the three-day cultural event, with a performance at the amphitheatre that has been set up at the India Gate lawns.

Modi also interacted with construction workers involved in the redevelopment of the Avenue and said they would be his 'special guests' during the Republic Day parade next year.

'With the redevelopment of the entire stretch, I have also become a part of this historic work. I will never forget this moment,' beamed Neeraj Kumar, who was among workers involved in the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment.

Vendors who hoped to profit from Thursday's festivities, however, were a disappointed group, with few able to make their ways open to the general public. Most of them were asked to vacate the area.

Bipin Kumar, who sells ice cream in the vicinity, said he was hopeful the event would bring several people to the venue. 'The traffic police told us we were not allowed to stand there so we kept moving. While some visitors did stop and buy ice cream, we had to eventually move away from Kartavya Path,' he said.

Some visitors who were around India Gate on Thursday said they were caught by surprise.

Siblings Aanand Upadhyay (25) and Parikshita Upadhyay (20), who were on a visit to Delhi, said they caught a glimpse of the renewed Avenue 'by chance'.

'We will be leaving Delhi on Friday. It was sheer chance that we ended up witnessing the ceremony. It appears to be a significant upgrade, but we hope it is kept clean,' Parikshita said.

'Over the years, we have been spending a lot of time at India gate lawns. The shade of jamun trees serve as excellent spaces to relax. It looks much more sleek now with lights and pathways but I hope they allow people to use it like old times,' said 31-year-old Sandeep Singh from Bihar's Hajipur, who is preparing for competitive exams in Delhi.

The stretch of Kartavya Path from Man Singh Road towards Rashtrapati Bhawan was partially thrown open for visitors after 8.45pm, but with barricades and security personnel in place, few made their way to the newly verdant greens.

After the Prime Minister's address ended, the spotlight turned instead to two stages set up near India Gate and between the Kartavya Path stretch between Rafi Marg and Man Singh Road where performances from various states were held to showcase the various hues of local cultural dances.

Among those were a group of 15 tribal artistes from Adilabad in Telangana, who performed the Gussadi dance of the Adilabad Gonds tribe.

Uday Kumar (30), the head of the group, said the dance dates back thousands of years, and is now performed on major festivals such as Sankranti and Dussehra.

'The dance is traditionally dedicated to the snake god. We are a group of 15 people who arrived in Delhi on Monday. Besides showcasing our art, all the dancers have jobs as teachers, farmers and in the private sector. We are proud to be a part of this historic event,' he added.

Onlookers also enjoyed the Dalkhai dance of Odisha.

Bausdev Behera, the flautist in the 15-member troupe said that the dance is performed on the eighth day of Navratri.

'Sisters keep a fast for their brothers and the dance is held at night in front of the Goddess Durga. It is an integral part of Navratri in Odisha,' Behera added.",Delhi's revamped Central Vista Avenue opens to the public | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,9,2022

Environmentalist and author Pradip Krishen, who is advising the designers in the Central Vista redevelopment project, said that the new plantation scheme has been designed to replicate the British design for the Capital in 1912. It will also rectify the errors that the city's horticulture departments have made over the years.

Krishen said that initially only 13 tree species were chosen to line the avenues of Lutyens' Delhi; the number was subsequently increased to 16.

'The criteria were that the shape and the size of the trees chosen for that particular avenue should be just right in order to frame the feature they were facing. Three things were kept in mind: they had to be the right size, they had to be evergreen and they should not be common. That was the reason why species that the Mughals preferred, such as mango, or shisham did not find space in the avenue scheme,' Krishen explained.

Lutyens's plan accounted for around 450 trees in all, of which at least 385 were rai-jamun trees. Today, however, there are at least 3,200 large trees (4,000 if the smaller ones and shrubs are included). Around 1,080 are rai-jamun trees, a spokesperson for HCP Design Planning and Management Private Limited (HCP), the firm in charge of the project design said. Of these, 21 are being transplanted to make space for amenities like toilets for the public, the spokesperson added.

To be sure, trees of this size can't usually be successfully replanted.

Historians said that Lutyens initially designed this part of Delhi with all streets crossing at right angles. However, this was later tweaked, taking into account the dusty Delhi weather. Thus, the trees, hedges, even roundabouts were carefully designed as barriers to seasonal dust storms.

Krishen said that as an advisor to the Central Vista project, he has tried to retain the original patterns of Lutyens's design as much as possible. He said that the new design might also rectify the plantation done by the Central Public Works Department and the New Delhi Municipal Council over the years.

For instance, there was an original grid plan for the plantation of jamun trees. The design, which was called the 'diamond grid', only involved around 385 jamun trees, all planted in a diamond-like pattern.

'If you look at aerial images, the pattern is very interesting. It's like small Xs drawn all over and at each end of the X a jamun tree was planted, and the rest of the space was left empty. But the CPWD in their course of plantation completely lost track of this pattern, mainly because they did not understand the original design,' Krishen said.

The spaces left empty by the original gardeners to create that pattern, was filled in by planting new jamun trees.

But no one wanted to go back to that plan entirely or immediately because 'that would mean getting rid of a huge number of jamun trees and nobody wanted that,' he added.

Krishen said that it was finally decided to have a 'long-term replacement strategy'.

'We decided to adopt a scheme with a validity of at least 30 years, which means that in the future when a tree dies, it will not be replaced by a jamun tree so that a khali (empty space) remains khali and a bhara (occupied space) remains bhara, or will be replaced by a tree of another species,' Krishen said.

Project documents shows that 26 old jamun trees will be affected during constructions. These nearly 100-year-old trees, planted around 1921, are to be transplanted and not felled, but experts fear that they might not survive the transplantation.

Based on documents and aerial photographs dating back to the 1920s,HCP was able to recreate Lutyens' tree plan along the avenue: a serrated grid of trees, comprising primarily of rai-jamun trees that flanked either side of the Central Vista Avenue and pines, maulsari and bistendu trees that were to cluster around what is now Vijay Chowk. The trees along the avenue criss-crossed over the waterways providing ample sitting space under the shade.

HCP's proposal, based on advice from horticultural experts Kishen (based in Delhi) and Dr Prabhakar Rao (based in Bengaluru), aims to create a 'tree plan' that will be realized over the next two to three decades as these trees reach their natural end.

'The draft plan for the plantation at Central Vista Avenue is likely to be a more populated criss-cross grid, similar to Lutyens' pattern, which aims to preserve as many of these trees as possible without needing to transplant them,' the HCP spokesperson added.

' Many of the jamun trees are already at the end of their life cycles and are likely to die over the next two decades. So when they die, what should come up in that space? Should it be left alone? We're trying to come up with a planting plan based on Lutyens' cross pattern,' the spokesperson said

This comes in the midst of ongoing litigations challenging the land use and the project. While the urban planners and civil society members say that it is a violation of the court order, a senior ministry official aware of the development said that the land use change has been done as per the law.

For the Centre's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, land use of seven land parcels, including district parks, spread over 101.1 acres has to be changed. While the land use of 86.1 acre has been notified, the land use of 15-acre land parcel, where the vice-president's new house is proposed, will be changed later on, said a ministry official. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had recently invited suggestions and objections for the change of land use for the 15-acre plot after some changes were made in the redevelopment plan.

The notified changes include a 15-acre plot on Dalhousie Road near South Block where the PM's new residence has been proposed by the firm selected to redesign the Central Vista. The land use has been changed from recreational to residential.

The 15-acre plot on Dalhousie Road houses old hutments, which are owned by the Defence establishment, a senior official said. HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, the Ahmedabad-based firm appointed as the consultant for the Central Vista Project, has proposed the shifting of PM's residence closer to South Block on Dalhousie Road.

The Friday's notification also includes a 9.5-acre plot where the new Parliament building is proposed. The land use has been changed from recreational to Parliament House. Last month, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had applied for environment clearance for the Parliament building from the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). In March, the EAC had deferred the clearance stating the proposal will be reconsidered after the pending court cases are resolved.

There are two petitions which were filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the basis for the land use change and short notice given by the land-owning agency for the public hearing.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court decided that all cases concerning land use changes and other allied issues relating to redevelopment of Central Vista area should be heard by it, considering the larger public interest involved in the matter.

Anuj Srivastava, spokesperson LokPATH and one of the petitioners against the project, said, 'The notification for the change of land use is a deeply disturbing development. There are several unresolved issues as brought out in various representations to the DDA.It is evident that large scale changes are being carried out in haste without any thought for the consequences. The Supreme Court has also stated that 'any step taken by the authorities, in the meantime will be subject to the outcome of the proceedings. We are hopeful in these trying times better sense will prevail and this step would be rescinded.'

But a senior housing ministry official said, 'The notification has been done following the due procedure and as per law.'","For Central Vista project, Centre approves land use change for 86.1 acres - Hindustan Times",3,2020

The renovation of the Parliament building is a segment in the Centre's larger Central Vista project which includes a new Parliament house, a new Central secretariat complex for ministries, and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2024.

The Delhi Development Authority last December had changed the land use of a 15-acre plot from recreational to residential on Dalhousie Road near South Block where the PM's new residence has been proposed.

The opposition parties have criticised the Centre's decision to go ahead with the project as the country battles the deadly coronavirus disease.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to the PM, on April 10, in which she urged him to suspend the 20,000 crore allocated to the project.

'At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained,' she wrote.

Trinamool leader and MP Mahua Moitra also slammed the move.

820,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/what-to-expect-at-redeveloped-central-vista-avenue-101662605510677.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the revamped Central Vista Avenue as part of the Centre's 13,500-crore redevelopment of the area. It is the first of the five projects to be completed as part of the redevelopment and is being opened after 19 months with some restrictions on vending, especially food items. Here is what to expect from the revamped public space and what went into giving the space a new look:

New features

Walkways: Close to 16.5 km of them have been constructed across lawns and along the newly renamed Kartavya Path. The lawns have been paved with granite in the Lakha stone colour. Stainless steel tactile indicators would guide visually impaired persons about the change in slope and directions.

Pedestrian underpasses: One of the biggest difficulties visitors faced was crossing the road at Janpath and C-hexagon. Four pedestrian underpasses have been constructed on the two roads to link the lawns and provide smooth access to India Gate. Currently, traffic movement near the India Gate gets affected due to an at-grade pedestrian crossing. The parking facility has been developed along the lawns. To provide smooth access to India Gate and connect the lawns, four pedestrian underpasses have been constructed, said a Central Public Works Department (CPWD) official.

Public safety: To ensure this, new streetlights have been installed in the area. While 74 heritage light poles along Kartavya Path have been refurbished, close to 1000 new streetlights have been installed along it as well as canals, parking spaces, new plazas, and tree avenue. Close to 300 CCTV cameras have been installed in the area. The new system will be able to detect unattended objects.

Maintaining greenery: Officials said that maintaining the green spaces was a huge challenge earlier. A substantial part of the redevelopment work has been to correct the slope of the lawns and install a weather-based water sprinkling system.Earlier, there were portions in the lawns where water would stagnate, especially during monsoon, making the entire area inaccessible for the public. 'But now, we have corrected the slope of the lawns and integrated them with drain channels to minimise damage caused by stagnation of water,' said a CPWD official. 101 acres of lawns have been replanted with different species of grass, appropriate to their location.

Amenity blocks: Eight amenity blocks have been constructed on either side of Kartavya Path with toilets and drinking water facilities.

Vending zone: Seven such zones, including two near India Gate at C-Hexagon, have been developed. Of the seven vending zones, five have space for 40 vendors each. There are two amenity blocks at India Gate with 16 shops. An official said these shops will be given to state emporiums or artisans to display their goods. In the revamped avenue, visitors are likely to miss the popular ice-cream carts along the Kartavya Path during evening hours as these will not be allowed initially. An official said no decision has been taken as of now regarding whether to allow these vendors on Kartavya Path or not. 'We have to look at the situation once the area is open to the public. But the ice-cream vendors can sell their items in the earmarked vending zones.'

Officials called maintenance of the area a huge challenge and said that selling food items at the lawns near India Gate at C-hexagon and between C-hexagon and Mansingh Road will not be allowed. Selling food items on the two lawns near India Gate will not be allowed. People will be discouraged to eat on the first two lawns near India Gate. Fifty security personnel will be deployed to ensure no damage is caused to the newly constructed infrastructure. Selling or eating food on the lawns near the India Gate will not be allowed like earlier.

Additional parking space: The CPWD has created space for 1117 cars and 40 buses. The parking will be free for the first two months.

Republic Day arrangement: Officials said measures have been taken to provide permanent facilities for the Republic Day parade in the redeveloped avenue. Earlier, the preparations for the parade used to start two-three months in advance and it would take weeks to dismantle the temporary structures. Due to movement of heavy vehicles and the temporary structures that were erected for the parade, the lawns would get damaged. With the new system, officials will take just a few days to make all the arrangements. Measures have been taken to ensure minimum disturbance at lawns while making arrangements for the parade.

People-friendly area: New signage have been put in place to guide people while CPWD has installed 422 red sandstone benches.

All services underground: All cables for the public announcement systems, CCTVs, Wi-Fi, etc have been placed underground along the Kartavya Path.

Boating: Officials said that boating will be allowed in canals located on the first lawn opposite India Gate and the other near Krishi Bhavan.

Bridges over canals: Sixteen bridges have been constructed over the canals along the Kartavya path to connect the front lawn with the rear lawns and parking area on each side. The 3.2-km-long canals on both sides have been refurbished and 60 aerators have been installed for maintenance.",What to expect at redeveloped Central Vista Avenue | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,9,2022

Addressing a press conference to highlight the achievement of the Modi government as it completes eight years, Puri said, 'We wanted to hold the January 26 parade on Central Vista Avenue and succeeded. Due to the severity of winter, other problems and Covid restrictions, there has been some delay It will be completed in 10 days or so. Our main focus now is on the Parliament building which will be completed before the winter session.'

The construction work of Central Vista Avenue was to be completed before the Republic Day parade.

While work on the three Common Central Secretariat buildings and the Vice President's house is going on, a senior ministry official said, 'The next project to be taken up is the construction of MP chambers, which will come up where Transport Bhawan is located.'

The offices in Transport Bhawan will be shifted to two buildings that are being constructed at KG Marg.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) recently reinvited bids for the construction and maintenance of the Executive Enclave, which will include the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), India House, Cabinet Secretariat, and National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). Bids for 1,160-crore Executive Enclave were first invited in November last year and were opened in March. Ahluwalia Contracts India Limited emerged as the lowest bidders for the project.

As per the tender document, the project cost has increased from 1,160 crore to 1,316 crore. A senior official said, 'The project cost has gone up as the scope of work has been increased.'

The redevelopment of the 608-crore Central Vista Avenue, part of the Centre's 13,500 crore Central Vista redevelopment project, started in February last year. Under the project, Rajpath and the area along it between Vijay Chowk to India Gate is being redeveloped. The project's initial deadline was December 2021.

The work involves construction of four pedestrian underpasses, eight amenity blocks, relaying of Rajpath and construction of pathways along it and in the lawns, improving the canals and constructing 16 permanent bridges over them, and the construction of underground utility ducts for electric and other cables etc.

CPWD officials said that they faced many challenges in completing the work. 'The pace of work was affected due to the second and third waves of Covid. Work had to be stopped due to unprecedented rain last year. For the Republic Day parade, special arrangements were made and then we restarted the work. It took some time to mobilise resources,' said a CPWD official.","New Parliament by October, Central Vista Avenue by mid-June: Union minister | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times",6,2022

Taking to Twitter, Gandhi urged the Central government to work with a vision to curb the growing Covid cases and not spend money on Central Vista during these challenging times.

'Central Vista -not essential. Central Govt with a vision- essential,' he tweeted.

Last week also, Gandhi questioned the government's priorities in handling Covid and the Central Vista project. 'No test, no vaccine, no oxygen and no ICU,' he tweeted.

The Opposition has been demanding that the fund for the project be devoted towards the country's Covid response.

Meanwhile, reports suggest that 180 vehicles have been granted permission to ferry workers to the Central Vista site even as the National Capital has been under lockdown for ten days now to flatten the Covid curve.

New Delhi saw its first weekend curfew on April 16, when the Central Public Works Department, which is overseeing the project, wrote to the Delhi Police that 'the project is time bound in nature and has to be finished by 30th November 2021' and the work is going on in three shifts.

On Sunday, Srinivas BV, the president of Indian Youth Congress, tweeted his disappointment about how the government is spending 2,000 crore on the Central Vista Project instead of buying beds and ventilators.

'It's unfortunate how the Central Government is spending money on the Central Vista Project instead of buying ventilators and ICU beds which would have saved the lives of lakhs of people. It's sad how the government is rooting for their own comfort over the lives of people.'

The Central Vista Redevelopment Project, which would include a triangular parliament building, common central secretariat and a refurbished 3km Rajpath, was announced in 2019. On January 5, 2021, the Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to it.

The Executive Enclave is the fourth project to be tendered by the CPWD as part of the 13,500-crore Central Vista redevelopment project. Bids for the project were first invited in November 2021 and the project cost was estimated around 1,171 crore. Ahluwalia Contracts India Limited emerged as the lowest bidder when the financial tender was opened in March this year. The construction work of the new Parliament building, central Vista Avenue and the three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat is currently going on.

A senior CPWD official said, 'But the Executive Enclave project was re-tendered as there were some additions to the overall project. The scope of work increased due to which the project cost also went up. The project was re-tendered in May.'

The Executive Enclave will come up near the South Block. The PMO, Cabinet secretariat, and NSCS secretariat will be four-storeyed buildings (ground plus three and basement) while the India House (which will be a Hyderabad House-like facility for high-level meetings) will be a double-storeyed building (ground plus one and basement).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday inaugurate the newly christened Kartavya Path from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and a statue of Bose as he opens to the public the first stage of Central Vista.

Officials said the cultural events will start from Thursday around 8.45pm after the inauguration of the Avenue and continue till September 11 between 7pm and 9pm.

A culture ministry official said a special 10-minute show on Bose's life would be projected at India Gate at 8pm from September 9 to 11. The cultural events and the show would be open to the public free of cost.

The Central Public Works Department has constructed four temporary stages for the cultural events on the 1.8km stretch between Mansingh Road and Rafi Marg on Kartavya Path.

Artists will perform at the newly constructed amphitheatre on the India Gate lawns, where Modi will unveil the statue of Bose. 'Around 30 artists will perform tribal folk art forms such as Sambalpuri, Panthi, Kalbelia, Kargam...with live music...,' a ministry official said.

The inauguration ceremony is likely to go on for 90 minutes and 1,500 guests have been invited to it. Officials anticipate a huge turnout, especially in the first few weeks.

The trees, or rather the pattern in which they are planted, were discovered during the course of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue, and the architects who discovered it believe they were planted this way for a reason -- the two architects of the original Central Vista, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker were both Freemasons.

The Freemasons Society, one of the oldest fraternal organisations in the world was established in 1717 in England, and for years misunderstood as a 'secret society'.

Pradip Krishen, author and environmentalist, who is also an adviser with the design committee of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, said that when the plantation plans of the area were being studied, a bunch of topiarised Bistendu trees stood out because they were planted in a peculiar pattern that was not in line with the rest of the plantations.

'All the trees planted in the avenue follow a certain pattern and these trees were an aberration and we could not understand why this was,' said Krishen.

'The group of trees initially seemed to have been planted randomly but later it was found that it represented the shape of a truncated hexagon, like the tip of a dovetail,' Krishen added.

Krishen explained that it subsequently emerged that the trees were planted in the sacred symbol of the Freemasons  the square and compasses.

Literature available at the Grand Lodge of India located at Delhi's Janpath, which is the centre of the Freemasons Society in India, shows that for modern Masons, the square and compasses symbol has a unique, profound meaning. The square symbolises virtue and the compass represents wisdom.

This symbol is found in all the buildings, literature, and monuments, associated with the fraternal organisation, across the world.

It also proudly decorates the entrance to the Grand Lodge in Janpath.

'It resides at the heart of Masonic lessons, beckoning all brothers to live a life that is honest, true, and dignified. Any travelling man understands that when he sees this symbol, whether on the fa�ade of a Masonic temple, the bumper sticker of a passing car, or a lapel pin of a colleague, he is in the company of friends,' an excerpt from the history of Freemasons reads.

Krishen said that this symbol seems to have been a piece of 'historical forensics' that was discovered by chance.

'This is an interesting tidbit. Maybe Edwin Lutyens wanted to leave this symbol as a secret for future Masons to discover. It has finally been found,' Krishen said.

While Krishen believes that this sign was left behind by Edwin Lutyens, the primary architect of the imperial capital of Delhi, another expert who was part of the Central Vista redevlopment project and spoke on condition of anonymity said that the plantation of the trees could also be the doing of his colleague Herbert Baker.

This assumption is based on the findings of more Masonic symbols and traditions in his other architectural work.

'We do not know anything for sure, but Baker is known to leave Masonic symbols. Some years back, there were reports of a school in Africa where a copy of a newspaper and some coins  a Masonic traditionwere found buried, believed to have been placed there while laying the foundation by Herbert Baker,' the person said.

This reference was corroborated by a news article published in The Standard, 'Why Freemason architect buried newspaper, coins under Nairobi School', in the year 2019.

The article read, 'In accordance to Masonic culture, a copy of the East African Standard newspaper and some coins were placed under the foundation stone of Nairobi School... The coins and newspaper had the date and year in which the stone was laid in a 'time capsule' custom not only meant to connote the year of construction, but also to bring good luck.'

The Freemasons Society in India did not respond to Hindustan Times' queries about whether it knew of the 'little secret' left behind by a fellow Mason.

'Many famous English professionals, including architects, doctors, lawyers and statesmen at the time were members (of the Freemasons Society). Many historians have spoken about and are still researching about the possible influences in the work done by them,' said an office bearer from the Grand Lodge of India, the governing body of Freemasonry in India.

The Janpath Freemasons' Lodge was designed by architect FB Blomfield, a contemporary of Lutyens and Baker.",Trees lined in Freemason symbol form hide in plain view on Central Vista | Latest News India - Hindustan Times,10,2022

The 19th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit

""Yes, of course. The Republic Day parade will take place there, and the handover is being done in bits and pieces, and it will be done. So that is not the big issue,' Patel said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Tuesday. 'By the end of 2022, before the next winter session (in 2022), the country will have a new Parliament building,' Patel said.

The leading architect acknowledged of receiving criticism, but said he has approached the Central Vista project with respect, to honour the history associated with it.

In a conversation with Hindustan Times' Editor-in-Chief R Sukumar, Bimal Patel also stressed that he approached redevelopment of historically important locations 'respectfully'.

'In one word, if you ask me, approach it respectfully. There is no question about it. It has to be a respectful approach. However, the fact that it is a historically important site and should be treated respectfully, I believe, should not paralyse us. We must do what is necessary to transform these places so that they function for us as well today.

That said, the next issue is to start identifying the problems with the way they are functioning today,' said Patel who is also associated with the Sabarmati Ashram project.

'So if one takes a simple approach like that, I think one comes up with solutions that make sense today; with a lot of respect for the history and the ethos of the place. I believe that is the right way to about it,' he said, adding that he understood the well-founded apprehensions that people have. 'So much of change that we see around us is problematic, it takes away old memories'.

Patel also rebutted criticism around the Sabarmati Ashram project, underscoring that this was only a restoration project, not a redevelopment project. At the same time, he stressed that people talked about modernism as completely always opposed to Gandhian simplicity. He cited the Gandhi Memorial Museum, completed in 1963, as an example.

'Because Charles Correa's museum there... remember that he did not mimic Gandhi ashram. What he did was use perfectly modern materials like brick and concrete to build a modern building that had the ethos of Gandhi Ashram. This can be done. So my point is very simple. let's not oppose modernism to simplicity, authenticity, and austere architectural character,' he said.

Patel said he, like many others, admired the spartan, authentic qualities of the original Gandhi Ashram.

The Gandhi Ashram used to occupy about 40 acres of land.

'On it, there were 60 odd buildings that were spread out... the Gandhi Ashram we see today is only over 5 acres. Out of that, only three acres, five buildings have been preserved as they used to be and they are available for visitors to see... The idea of the project is to expand the Gandhi Ashram to cover all the original buildings and the original buildings, most of which exist today but are in a derelict state are to be restored and brought back to their original condition,' he said.

'This is a restoration project. This is Gandhi Ashram restoration, not Gandhi Ashram redevelopment'.","HTLS 2021: New Parliament building by end of 2022, says Central Vista architect Bimal Patel - Hindustan Times",11,2021

In a release, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs talked about the funds for the project, environmental issues surrounding it and other things. Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri had recently attacked the Congress, terming the opposition's objections 'bizarre.'

On opposition's charge that 20,000 crore is being spent on the project this year during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry said that the redevelopment plan was envisaged in 2019, many months before the outbreak of the pandemic, and it is a generational infrastructure investment project, involving multiple projects spread over six years. It also said that 20,000 crore is gross rough estimate of all the planned development/redevelopment works.

""Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost 862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost 477 crore have been awarded and works are underway. Expenditure incurred on these 2 projects till March 2021 is 195 crore and budget provision for 2021-22 is 790 crore,"" the ministry said.

It also rubbished the reports that 13,450 crore is being incurred on new house for Prime Minister. The estimate includes multiple projects, including 10 buildings, the ministry said, adding that the construction work for the Prime Minister's residence has not yet been tendered and no sanction has been accorded by the government. ""The cost for the PM's residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media,"" the ministry said.

Further, the ministry rejected the charge of diverting funds from public healthcare and Covid-19 response to the Central Vista Project. The ministry said that in Union Budget 2020-21, there was a 137% increase from previous year's budget estimate in allocation for public healthcare and well-being expenditure. "" 35,000 crore of the annual allocation has been allocated as a one-time grant towards Covid-19 vaccination, significantly more than the cost of the Central Vista redevelopment project. Thus, the one-time amount for vaccination for FY 2021-22 is 175% more than the total budget for the Central Vista project, which is expected to be completed by 2026,"" the ministry said.

Justifying the ongoing work at the project site, the central ministry said that stopping the work at this stage will entail creating liabilities for the government under the existing contracts and the workers' interest. It also cited inflation as a key issue if the project is delayed.

The Delhi high court on May 31 dismissed a plea against the ongoing construction activities of the Central Vista Redevelopment project and terming the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) as ""illegal motive"" to halt the construction work.

Talking about the need for a new Parliament house, the housing ministry said that the present Parliament House, completed in 1927, was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy and it already highly stressed. ""If the strength of the Parliament is increased after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026, it will be necessary to ensure that Parliament House has the facilities for a larger Parliament to function,"" the ministry's release said.

The government further said that environmental sustainability is at the core of the Central Vista project, debunking the myth that it is contributing to environmental damage. ""The projects will result in overall increase in green cover. Trees will be transplanted in Eco-Park being developed by NTPC at Badarpur after due permissions from competent authorities. Steps are being taken to minimise on-site air emissions, noise, wastewater discharge, soil erosion as well as construction waste,"" the ministry said.

The ministry also promised that none of the heritage buildings - India Gate, Parliament, North & South Blocks, National Archives or any other - will be demolished. ""While these heritage buildings retain their architectural majesty, they are under severe stress and in need of comprehensive upgradation. Therefore, the heritage buildings that fall under the scope of the Central Vista development/redevelopment project will be appropriately retrofitted, as per Heritage Conservation standards, and refurbished for their future use,"" it added, rejecting yet another charge.

Rejecting the allegation that procedures were circumvented during the approval process of the Central Vista project, the ministry of housing said gave a detailed account of the key steps undertaken. It also said that all the processes have been followed in getting statutory approvals for the project. The ministry further said that the Central Vista project will create additional public and green spaces.

The charges of lack of public disclosure, the project being a drain on resources and government continuing it during second wave of Covid-19 pandemic by invoking Essential Services Act were also rejected by the ministry.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.","Centre busts myths around Central Vista, says 'claims mischievously exaggerated' | Latest News India - Hindustan Times",6,2021

'I am have been noticing that for these past few months that a false narrative is being created. And if the political class should be careful if it talks about these things. Others need to be careful as well,' Puri, the Union minister of housing and urban affairs, said during a press briefing.

The 13,450 crore Central Vista project has faced criticism from various quarters and political parties. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticised the Centre for executing the project, terming it a ""criminal wastage"" and asked it to focus on people's lives during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Puri pointed out the the Central Vista project has legal clearance that 'none of the historic, cultural, iconic buildings will be touched and will remain exactly as they are' and that people must understand the difference that the Central Vista and Central Avenue are two different projects. 'The old Parliament building comes under Seismic Zone IV and  the people's representatives should be able to sit and conduct the business,' he also said.

'Currently, two new projects are underway -the New Parliament Building and Central Vista Avenue. A decision on these projects was taken before the pandemic,' he said.

The minister cited an article written by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh calling for a new Parliament building and said that in 2012 Meira Kumar's OSD wrote to the housing ministry's secretary saying clearing that a decision has been taken to build a new Parliament building.

The Central Public Works Department recently said the new buildings will have parking for at least 16,000 cars and the new service roads will ensure smooth flow of traffic on main roads.

Puri also pointed to the Delhi High Court's dismissal of a plea seeking to halt construction work at Central Vista Avenue on Monday as the court said it was 'a motivated petition'. The high court said the Public Interest Litigation or PIL was genuine and also imposed a fine of 1 lakh on the petitioners citing lack of bonafide on their side.

It has been almost 20 months since street vendors were removed as part of the redevelopment work around the area. With the zone now reopened for the public, Das hopes to find a space for himself.

While the plan for the new avenue places a few restrictions on vendors, dedicated zones have been developed on each side of Kartavya Path, located between the front lawn and parking lot on both sides, to allow visitors to buy snacks and knick-knacks, as before.

According to a New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) official, there were more than 200 vendors operating along the stretch when it was handed over to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) for the redevelopment work in 2018.

The new rules specify that vendors will no longer be allowed to sell food on the front lawns between Man Singh Road and C-Hexagon.

A senior official from the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment of the Central Vista project, said, 'In each vending zone, there will be space for 40 vendors. But people can't set up big carts here. These have to be people who have small set-ups. Street vendors will not be allowed to sell food in the front lawns between C-Hexagon and Man Singh Road.'

Curbs also extend to visitors as well.

'We will also discourage people from eating in the front lawns on Kartavya Path near India Gate. Eating food in the lawns at C-Hexagon near India Gate is not allowed in any case.'

Ice-cream vendors will not be allowed at the site initially, said senior Union housing and urban affairs ministry officials, adding that a call will be taken after the public return to the space.

'No decision has been taken as of now. But the ice-cream carts will not be allowed on Kartavya Path initially. Vendors can sell items in the vending zone. We have to look at the situation once the area is open to the public,' the official said.

Das, who used to sell snacks and cold drinks at Man Singh Road for the past two decades but now sells his wares at Ashoka Road, said, 'Tomorrow, we will get some idea about where we can sit and restart our business. We have been told that the government has created new vending zones. But I hope I can do business from my old location.'

A senior NDMC official said the process of surveying and allocation of space to street vendors will have to be started afresh.

'A town vending committee for New Delhi is already in place. This body will allot vendors these spaces and decide timings. We may have to rotate the street vendors based on space availability,' the official said.

'Before the revamp work began, there used to be around 200-300 street vendors along this belt but the number of licensed vendors was only a minuscule fraction of this number,' the official added on condition of anonymity.

Rakesh Kumar, an ice-candy seller, said he has been vending at India Gate for over two decades. 'At India Gate, we used to earn more than 500 or more daily. During weekends, the business used to be really good. Last few years have been tough due to Covid and when we came back to work, we were told that the area will be redeveloped. With Rajpath (Kartavya Path) reopening now, we all are hoping that business will get back to normal,' said Kumar.

The refurbished avenue will have ample parking space to accommodate more than 1,000 cars on both sides of Kartavya Path, a big change for visitors who earlier had to depend on unauthorised parking lots allowed by the authorities so that the vehicles do not lead to traffic jams.

'The parking facility will be available free of cost for the first few months. But we have asked the NDMC to take over the parking lots,' said a senior housing and urban affairs ministry official.

The CPWD has created parking spaces for 1,117 cars and 40 buses. The parking lots are connected to the pedestrian underpasses so that visitors can easily access all the lawns.

Initially, parking for around 700 vehicles will be allowed. 'In two parking lots, work related to the common central secretariat is going on. These will open after a few months,' said a CPWD official aware of the development.

A senior NDMC official said, 'There are only two official parking areas around the stretch in the front area of Shastri Bhavan at Dr Rajendra Prasad Road and in front of Nirman Bhavan. Earlier, there was unauthorised parking behind the canals, which was being allowed to take place to avoid congestion and traffic jam on main arterial roads.'

The official added that the old parking areas were operating unofficially.

'For instance, the space near the Vigyan Bhavan was used for excess parking for government events and even during the Parliament sessions. Similarly, media vans were allowed to park near the fountain on Rajpath based on a request from the ministry of information and broadcasting but it was not an official parking lot. Under the new system, the parking will be streamlined,' the official said.

NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay said the council hasn't been formally informed about the role it will be required to play in parking management. 'We will inform the public about the details of parking management after an official handover or communication from CPWD. So far our role is restricted to providing basic obligatory functions,' he said.","Central Vista: In refreshed Avenue, vendors hope to embrace new role in fixed zones | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times",9,2022

'There are two plazas in the Central Vista, the south and the north plaza. Each day the sound and drama division under the Central Bureau of Communication will organise several events that also convey a social message there,' an official said on condition of anonymity.

The events will start at sundown and continue until 8pm. The public can view the performanceswhich include solo dances, group dances, varying forms of folk dances, instrumental performances, group songs, musicals, street plays, puppetry and, at a later stage, even ballet free of charge.

'The events began on September 12. These programmes typically begin after sunset and go on till 8-8.15pm.

Dance forms from Uttarakhand, the northeastern states, Maharashtra, and the southern states, such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, are also expected to be incorporated in the programme. Ties with several other ministries are also in the works, officials said.

The turnout so far has been good, a second official added. 'There is a footfall of nearly a thousand people a day, but there are no concrete records to show the exact numbers,' the official added.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the nodal agency for the Central Vista redevelopment project, has developed two amphitheatres on both sides of India Gate with a seating capacity for 250 people each. 'The cultural events are taking place in these two amphitheatres. There is ample space in the lawns from where people can watch the events,' a CPWD official said.

There will also be a specialised drive to mark occasions. 'Important events, such as the raktadan amrit mahotsav (blood donation drive) will also be highlighted,' the official quoted above said.

He added that as tribute to freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, whose statue was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the launch of the redeveloped Central Vista last week, each performance ends with the song 'kadam kadam badhaye ja', the marching song of Bose's Indian National Amy.

The team is also working to promote the health ministry's nutrition month programme this September. 'Special programmes are also being designed for October 2Gandhi Jayanti,' the official said.

According to the official, the programmes are at a nascent stage and more collaborations can be expected in the future. 'The idea is to use the stage to communicate tailored and important messages to the public by weaving them into entertainment. It will be a continuous project, one month is just a starting point,' the official said.

Meanwhile, the CPWD on Monday removed the arrangements that were made for the initial three-day long cultural events.

According to senior CPWD officials, issues related to vendors, parking, maintenance of green areas, water supply etc. are being looked into. 'Meetings are being held to look into these issues. In the next three-four days, a strategy will be formulated. But all this in the discussion stage,' a senior CPWD official aware of the development said.

As of now, the CPWD has outsourced the sanitation and horticulture work. 'Close to 500 people have been deployed for sanitation work and 150 people to maintain the green spaces. As of now, we don't have any restriction on the movement of people. We are requesting people not to eat food on the lawns.

Some of these hutments served as stables for British Army horses more than 75 years ago. As many as 27 wings of the defence ministry, including a navy station INS India, the Armed Forces Clinic and a medical wing of the armed forces have been operating from these hutments for several decades.

On September 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the new defence ministry office complex at Africa Avenue, paving the way for the relocation to begin, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.

'The shifting of offices will free 50 acres of land for Central Vista development. The defence ministry will vacate 9.2 lakh square feet of space in these hutments and take up 9.6 lakh square feet in two new multi-storeyed complexes that are spread over a total area of 13 acres,' said a second official.

The complex at Africa Avenue is scattered across four blocks and offers a space of 5.08 lakh square feet while the KG Marg set up has three blocks and an office area of 4.52 lakh square feet.

The new office complexes have been constructed at a cost of 775 crore provided by the defence ministry, with the work carried out by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Central Vista project, the second official said. The two complexes together have parking space for 1,500 cars.

Instead of being spread out in various hutments and old buildings (A, B, E, G, H, J, L& M Block, Plot No 30 and Plot No.108 and Jodhpur House), co-location of these buildings will ensure greater efficiency and working, he said. The new buildings will also provide modern amenities, connectivity and welfare facilities like canteens and banks. The construction of the new complexes did not involve uprooting of trees, he added.

According to the Central Vista plan approved by the Centre, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled. The Prime Minister's residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block complex while the residence of the Vice President is proposed to be relocated behind North Block.

On June 30, HT reported the vice president's enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years.

It has witnessed changes since it came into being over 100 years ago with the birth of New Delhi as India's capital. Starting as Kingsway during colonial rule, it was renamed Rajpath post-independence. After India's Independence, it continued to be the centre of political and administrative power. The lawns and fountains along the important stretch became among the most public spaces in the capital and it also serves as the site for the annual Republic Day parade.

Kingsway

When the announcement for the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi was made in 1911, Raisina Hill was identified as the location for the new centre of power. Over the next two decades, New Delhi was carved out. The town planning committee settled upon an area that lay to the south of Shahjahanabad. While not very built up, this area had an important elevation through which one could see the previous cities of Delhi.

The layout of the new city around Raisina was structured on a geometric grid with the seat of power at the apex and two ceremonial avenues intersecting each other at the centre point. Under the British, the nomenclature of roads was done keeping in mind the hierarchy of the British monarchy. Among them, the utmost importance was accorded to the road connecting the Viceroy's House (Rashtrapati Bhawan). Described as the Central Vista, this stretch was known as the Kingsway (Rajpath). Perpendicular to this road ran the Queen's Way (Janpath).

Kingsway is believed to have been named after king George V or could have been a generic reference applicable to successive monarchs. The transfer of capital took place during George V's reign.

Rajpath

After independence, Kingsway was changed to Rajpath. It was seen as an act of appropriation and India's democratisation. In 1955, Queensway became Janpath (People's Way) and Kingsway became Rajpath (Royal Way).

Kartavya Path

The New Delhi Municipal Council, the civic body of the area, unanimously approved the renaming of the central avenue from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate along with the Central Vista lawns to Kartavya Path on Wednesday. It said the old name was a symbol of the colonial legacy, and that the new designation fits the symbolic value of the central ceremonial avenue.",From Kingsway to Kartavya Path: Evolution of Central Vista's names | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,9,2022

A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said, 'Prayer for listing or hearing the review petitions in open court is rejected. The present review petitions have been filed against the final judgment and order dated January 5, 2021. We have perused the review petitions as well as the grounds in support thereof.

The dissenting verdict was by Justice Sanjiv Khanna which held that the change of land use did not follow the process under law for adequate consultation and public participation.

The majority verdict, on the other hand, took the view that in a given case, it is for the legislature to decide by law whether personal oral hearing is required, mere representation is to be invited, or the matter calls for public discussion and not the Court.

It noted that the land use change was not of a 'radical character' as it was meant for similar purpose of having government offices, public and semi-public use and recreation.

'The project does not involve any conversion into private ownership and has no element whatsoever of permitting commercial use of vital public resources. The proposed project is in line with the standards of public trust and the petitioners have failed to point out any circumstance which would suggest otherwise,' the majority judgment had stated.

It did not agree with the petitioners that the entire Central Vista area was a heritage zone. However, the majority view held that the Government will have to take approvals from the Heritage Conservation Committee and municipal authorities before construction of the new Parliament begins. The Centre had appointed HCP Design, Planning and Management as consultant for the Central Vista project in September 2019. This decision too was approved by the court.

The project to modernise India's power corridor was first proposed in 2019 but quickly ran into controversy with opposition parties, civil society members and activists first questioning the need for the revamp and later the decision to continue with the project in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government repeatedly defended the project, saying decades-old buildings were run down and needed a facelift.

On May 31, the Delhi high court turned down a petition that sought to halt a part of the redevelopment work and called the Central Vista an 'an essential project of national importance'.",Supreme Court refuses review of January 5 nod to Central Vista project | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,8,2021

The officers said 500 traffic police personnel were deployed in the area to manage traffic in and around India Gate.

All 10 roads leading to the C-Hexagon were barricaded to divert vehicles towards alternative routes prescribed for motorists.

According to traffic police, slow movement of traffic was reported from Firozeshah Road, Prithviraj Road, Barakhamba Road, Mandi House roundabout, Sikandra Road towards Tilak Marg, Minto Road towards Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Marg and Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, Bhagwan Das Road and Mathura Road. However, the jams did not persist for more than an hour, officers said.

Traffic was also heavy near Barapulla flyover from INA Market, Outer Ring Road between IP flyover and Ashram Chowk, Delhi Noida Direct (DND) flyway, and Mathura Road towards Badarpur. In central Delhi, Desh Bandhu Gupta Road, Faiz Road, Jhandewalan and Karol Bagh reported slow moving traffic.

The police and other agencies expected a huge turnout of people, especially children, at the Central Vista Avenue around the Kartavya Path after 9pm following its inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They expected a footfall of nearly 300,000 people and made special arrangements such as park-and-ride facilities from four pick-up points  Bhairon Marg, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Rajghat and Connaught Place.

Eventually, however, as crowds in the area remained thin, authorities scaled down traffic and security arrangements by 10pm.

835,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-run-over-paid-parking-at-central-vista-from-this-weekend-101663869975155.html,"After two weeks of free parking at the refurbished Central Vista, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) plans to start charging visitors using the parking lots of the avenue starting this weekend.

NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay said the parking lots at Kartavya Path, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 8, were to be kept free for 15 days as per announcements made that day, and this weekend onwards, it will be operated as a paid service. 'The charges will be same as at any other New Delhi area but people should preferably use public transportation to reach this stretch,' Upadhyay said.

The civic body is expected to hire a private concessionaire to manage the parking lots -- a process which is likely to take at least two months, according to Upadhyay. Till then, NDMC officials will manage the parking lots.

'Currently, 15 officials from the parking management department have been deployed by NDMC to manage Central Vista parking lots. We are also in the process of finalising the terms for appointing a private concessionaire to manage parking around the Central Vista. The process is in an advanced stage and tenders are likely to be floated in next week,' Upadhyay said.

There are nearly 125 parking sites (multilevel and surface) managed solely or jointly by the NDMC. Visitors pay a standard charge of 20 per hour for four wheelers, which can be charged up to maximum of 100, while for two wheelers, the rates are 10 per hour with a maximum of 50. The charges for buses are 80 an hour, with a maximum of 400.

At present, there are four designated parking sites on Kartavya Path, and the civic body has allowed parking for around 600 cars and 40 buses. For the convenience of visitors, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has created parking space for around 1,100 cars and 40 buses, which are connected with pedestrian underpasses so that visitors can easily access the lawns.

The parking sites developed by CPWD are located between Janpath and Rafi Marg, with space for around 500 cars; between C-Hexagon and Man Singh Road (200 cars); and Man Singh Road and Janpath (400 cars). Another parking space, between Man Singh Road and Janpath, is likely to take more time before it opens as construction agencies have taken over the area for ongoing work related to the Central Secretariat.

A senior NDMC official said that before the Central Vista revamp, there were only two official parking areas around the stretch -- near Shastri Bhavan at Dr Rajendra Prasad Road, and in front of Nirman Bhavan. There was also an unauthorized parking lot behind the canals, which was allowed to continue to avoid congestion and traffic jam on main arterial roads.

These parking areas were operating unofficially. 'The space near the Vigyan Bhavan was used for excess parking for government events and even during the Parliament sessions. Similarly, media vans were allowed to park near the fountain on Rajpath based on a request from the ministry of information and broadcasting but it was not an official parking lot. Under the new system, the parking will be streamlined,' an NDMC official said.",Free run over: Paid parking at Central Vista from this weekend | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,9,2022

India Gate Circle also known as C-Hexagon will be out of bounds for vehicular as well as general pedestrian movement from 6PM to 9PM on Thursday.

PM Modi will be inaugurating the new avenue in the presence of over 1,500 prominent dignitaries amid much fanfare.

The Central Vista Avenue and other public places around Rajpath, now renamed as 'Kartavya Path', such as lawns and fountains will be thrown open for the public after the inauguration ceremony is concluded.

As a result, the traffic police have anticipated a large turnout of people, especially children, to go up to a lakh in and around the avenue leading to congestion on all roads around India Gate.

Traffic police will deploy nearly 500 personnel and six traffic wing's deputy commissioners of police (DCPs).

As the inauguration ceremony is scheduled during the evening peak hours, those who will be affected will be those returning to their homes from offices.

Apart from making special traffic arrangements, the traffic police have been told that all central government offices located in New Delhi district will be closed post lunch on September 8 and non-essential staffers in ministries and government departments have been asked to work from home.

They had written letters to the ministries suggesting closure of the central government offices in central Delhi post lunch and issue work from home directions to non-essential staff.

On Wednesday evening, the traffic police carried out their full-dress rehearsal at and around the venue to gauge their preparedness and understand the traffic patterns and problems so that necessary rectifications may be made accordingly and in advance.

However, the C-Hexagon was not closed for vehicular and pedestrian movement during the rehearsal, as it may have created traffic mess and confusion among commuters, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Aalap Patel.

Affected roads, diversions and arrangements

The traffic police have already issued a detailed traffic arrangements plan, which includes several traffic restrictions and diversions. Information has been disseminated through various platforms such as social media, newspapers and FM channels.

In their advisory, the traffic police said that to facilitate the safety of pedestrians, including children, and to ensure smooth movement of traffic in New Delhi district (central Delhi), general traffic will be diverted from at least 10 roads leading to the C-Hexagon between 6PM and 9PM on Thursday.

The affected roads will be, Tilak Marg (from C-Hexagon to Bhagwan Dass Road crossing), Purana Quila Road (from C-Hexagon to Mathura Road), Shershah Road (from C-Hexagon to Mathura Road), Zakir Hussain Marg (from C-Hexagon to Subramanian Bharti Marg crossing), Pandara Road (from C-Hexagon to Subramanian Bharti Marg crossing), Shahjahan Marg (from C-Hexagon to Q-Point), Akbar Road (from C-Hexagon to Man Singh roundabout), Ashoka Road (from C-Hexagon to Jaswant Singh Road roundabout), Kasturba Gandhi Marg (from C-Hexagon to Madhav Rao Scindia Marg crossing), and Copernicus Marg (from C-Hexagon to Madhav Rao Scindia Marg crossing).

As a result of the diversions on the above-mentioned roads, as many as 12 connecting roads and junctions are expected to witness 'heavy volume' of traffic on Thursday.

These roads and junctions will be W-Point, Mathura Road, Ashoka Road, Q-Point, Prithviraj Road, Akbar Road, Subramanian Bharti Marg, APJ Abdul Kalam Road, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Windsor Place roundabout, Claridges Hotel roundabout, Man Singh Road, MLNP roundabout, Janpath, Feroz Shah Road, Mandi House roundabout, Sikandra Road.

'Commuters using two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers are requested to plan their journey in advance accordingly and avoid the mentioned roads for their convenience,' said DCP Patel.

Apart from the private vehicles, the traffic police will also be imposing diversions from as many as 16 points from 6PM on Thursday and it will be in force till 9PM.

The diversion points for the buses will be: Moti Bagh crossing on Ring Road, Bhikaji Cama crossing on Ring Road, south foot of Lodhi flyover, south foot of Moolchand flyover, ITO-IP flyover-Vikas Marg, Ring Road-Yamuna Vihar, Tis Hazari- roundabout Mori Gate junction, Panchkuian Road (Dayal Chowk), AIIMS flyover, SBM-Mathura Road, Neela Gumbad, Ashram Chowk, NH-24-Ring Road, Ring Road-ISBT, ISBT-T Point, and Dhaula Kuan.

'DTC, DIMTS and other public transport authorities are requested to plan the movement of their fleet vehicles in advance and avoid the mentioned roads for the convenience of the general public,' said DCP Patel.

The traffic police have also requested to organise a 'park and ride' facility from four pick-up points to C-Hexagon. The four pick-up points having parking facilities are Bhairon Road, Rajghat, Connaught Place, and JLN Stadium.

'The electric buses of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will be used for the park and ride facility for the public. As of now, six such buses have been approved. The number of buses will increase,' added the DCP.

In view of the large number of expected footfalls, people are advised to avoid using their private vehicles and cabs to travel to Central Vista. Instead, they should use public transport or avail 'park and ride' facilities, the traffic advisory read.

While acknowledging the need to preserve history, he said it should not hinder with progressive steps.

The 19th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit: Full coverage

'People using Parliament want the difficulties being faced in using the House to be addressed. The current structure was meant to be used as Council House and not as Parliament,' Patel said on Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS).

Speaking to Hindustan Times Editor-in-Chief R Sukumar, Patel said that rather being emotive about the changes being implemented in Central Vista, 'people should look at the facts and what is being proposed'.

'I can understand the concerns around moving the museum and handling of the artefacts. But it's the right time for our Republic to abandon the symbols of the Raj and turn them over to the people,' he added.

Patel said that the area where the new Central Vista is coming up is the most important public space, but it has many problems. 'It lacks toilets. You cannot have a three-kilometre-long garden and one public toilet at one end. It lacks lighting, which makes a lot of area inaccessible. The water bodies are beautiful but they are leaking.'

The proposed Central Vista Project envisages a new Parliament with a built-up area of around 60,000 square metres and expanded seating for over 1,200 members of both Houses, along with 51 Union ministries in 10 buildings.

Patel said that the project will be handed over to the Public Works Department (PWD) before the Republic Day parade next year.

The officer further said the area will be under surveillance from 32 rooftop locations, including 12 in outer and 20 in the inner barricading.

'The Multi Zone Door Frame Metal Detectors (DFMD) have been installed at 90 points in 25 locations in the area.

The Supreme Court (SC) in its judgement on the Central Vista redevelopment project on Tuesday has directed that 'the project proponent may set up smog tower(s) of adequate capacity, as being integral part of the new Parliament building project; and additionally, use smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase, in progress on the site.'

SC has also directed the Union environment ministry to consider issuing general directions for installation of smog towers as an integral part of all future major development projects, particularly in cities with high pollution levels.

However, experts are of the view that the environmental footprint left by a massive redevelopment project like the Central Vista cannot be neutralised effectively only by controlling air pollution during the construction phase.

'Unless there is a solid plan for controlling traffic emissions, short term strategies for future projects will not help. Also scientifically, there is no evidence that smog guns and smog towers work. In all future development projects, a holistic air pollution control strategy is needed for continuous control and mitigation,' said Sagnik Dey, Professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi.

A senior official of the environment ministry said, 'We will integrate the directions of SC in all future projects.'

Environmental and legal experts contend that the cumulative long term ecological impacts of the Central Vista project haven't been studied and the grand project was broken down into components for ease of getting clearances. This, they fear, could set a precedent for future townships and major development projects.

The Parliament project got the environmental nod in June. In December, the environment ministry's expert appraisal committee (EAC) granted conditional terms of reference (TOR) for development or redevelopment of common central secretariat buildings and central conference centre along with Prime Minister's Residence, SPG Building and Vice President's Enclaveall part of the Central Vista project--- as separate projects. This still doesn't include the New India Garden which is likely to come up near Yamuna and is also a part of the Central Vista project.

The 18 conditions specified by EAC for the central secretariat buildings include listing environmental, social and economic benefits of the project; cumulative impact of all development activities within Central Vista avenue including baseline environmental quality along with projected incremental load due to construction; environmental data on land, groundwater, surface water, air, biodiversity, noise and vibration, socio economic and health impacts; a detailed demolition plan, groundwater recharge and a traffic management plan; a recommendation from the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC).

While the total built-up area has been reduced from 18,37,057 sq m to 17,21, 500 sq m, the cost of the redevelopment project for the Central Secretariat buildings has increased by 1,656cr, from R11,794cr to R 13,450 cr. Minutes of EAC's meeting suggests around 4,58,820.0 sqm built up area will need to be demolished.

Experts have also stressed that the environment ministry considers the cumulative impacts of large building and redevelopment projects.

'Clearly the bench could not come to an agreement on whether the EC approval to the Parliament is legal or not.

The central vista redevelopment plan includes a slew of changes to existing structures, with a new Parliament building and a common secretariat for all central government offices among the most prominent new features.

According to presentations made by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design  the agency selected to carry out the works -- a new triangular Parliament building will come up next to the existing complex, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled.

The Prime Minister's residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block complex while the residence of the Vice President is proposed to be relocated behind North Block.

'Lutyens architecture was spectacular and there is no doubt about that. However, post-Independence the construction that took place in the vista didn't have an inspiring vision behind it. There was no comprehensive planning. Today, the structures are incoherent, there's no grand plans of buildings and precious land is used in an insufficient way,' chief architect of HCP Design, Planning & Management Private Limited, Bimal Patel, said.

Patel's firm was among the four firms that had been shortlisted for the project by the Centre.

The sweeping redevelopment, which is being handled by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, is slated to complete a new Parliament by India's 75th Independence Day in 2022, with the rest of the work scheduled to finish by 2024.

'We have seven main objectives to accomplish with the project that include modernising Parliament facilities, consolidating, rationalising, and synergising government functioning, providing adequate facilities for the Vice President and Prime Minister, refurbishing and better equipping the Central Vista avenue, strengthening cultural institutions in the vista, commemorating 75 years of independence and executing a large complex project such as this with ease,' Patel said.

To be sure, the plan is still a work in progress and the proposal could undergo several changes, he added.

Commemorating 75 years of india's Independence

On the proposed extended portion of the central vista, the government plans to construct a garden near the river Yamuna  a 'New India garden' -- to install structures commemorating 75 years of India's independence.

'Even Lutyens's original plan was envisaged to extending the Vista from the Ridge to the river. Presently the vista is from Rashtrapati Bhawan up to India Gate. One of the things we were asked was to see a possibility where that could be done,' Patel said.

'We will also set up walking and cycling paths all the way up till the garden past the Purana Quila route,' he added.

The government plans to hold a design competition for selecting the structures that should be put up at the proposed garden, a senior government official said, asking not to be named.

National arboretum

In extending the vista towards the west, the plan also involves a national biodiversity arboretum on about 48 acres of land beyond Mother Teresa Crescent.

'If you look at the land beyond the Crescent, which is essentially forest area, we plan to carve out about 48 acres for a national biodiversity arboretum which will have glass houses inside that will house endangered plant species of India,' Patel said.

National museums

Among the major changes is converting the North and South Block offices, which at present house some of India's key ministries such as home, defence, finance, as well as the Prime Minister's Office, into national museums.

The central government ministries will be shifted to a common secretariat.

'These blocks will be converted into national museums. It is proposed to make South Block a museum showcasing India's history up to 1857 and North Block can be a museum of India after 1857. These are just ideas right now,' Patel said, adding that the objective was to convey a shift in India's political ethos.

'What comes to mind is the Louvre which was the palace of the king that was converted into a museum. These are grand symbols of authority which are being opened to people,' Patel added.

Central secretariat

A total of 10 common secretariat buildings have been planned to serve as offices for about 70,000 central government employees.

'None of the new structures will be higher than the India gate. We have planned 10 symmetrical structures with modern offices. The plan is to also ensure they have courtyards in the centre for trees,' Patel said. 'At present only 22 of 51 government ministries reside in the Vista,' he said.

Central Avenue

The area around Rajpath is being referred as the Central Avenue. Among the plans to redevelop it include setting up civic amenities such as toilets, benches and organised parking.

'It has haphazard parking today, bad landscape, poor pathways and footpaths, it has ad-hoc vending spaces and inadequate facilities for national events and poor lighting...We will create pedestrian underpasses. One of the decisions was on whether to put either traffic below or the people below, in this case we thought that the traffic should stay on top, because some of the people who come from outside get to cross just once and get that one shot to view the great vista. You want to allow motorists to also have the same experience,' Patel said.

Cultural institutions

A plot of 15 acres has been identified by the Centre to relocate IGNCA near Jamnagar House.

'We will utilise IGNCA land for building the secretariat complex while IGNCA will be shifted. There is currently 15 acres of hutments at Jamnagar house which will be removed to make way for IGNCA. The idea is that this plot which is right across Hyderabad House will be a symmetric mirror image of the the building,' the government official said.

Prime Minister and Vice President's

residences

According to government officials, about 90 acres of prime land has been 'wasted' due to encroachment by hutments. This land will be reclaimed utilised to construct new residences of the Vice President and the Prime Minister.

'For the PM, there are two plots behind South Block which has hutments and in that there will be PMO with a garden in front for functions etc connecting it to his residence so that it will be walking distance,' the official said.

Parliament

The triangular complex proposed as the new Parliament Complex will be situated on plot inside the present complex. Contrary to his previous proposal of converting the old building into a museum, Patel said the plan now to utilize it for certain functions after going through remodeling and retrofitting. 'We have gone through the old drawings and ancient copies of the old building while designing the new building...among one of the issues is a seating the MPs. One of the options we have narrowed on is two-people per bench seating arrangement where the central hall can seat 800 MPs and 1200 for a joint session,' Patel said.

The plan also includes building of chambers for all MPs.",New central vista set to be expanded to Yamuna bank | Latest News India - Hindustan Times,1,2020

In the new proposal, total built-up area has been reduced from 18,37,057 sq.m to 17,21, 500 sq.m, and the cost of the redevelopment project has increased by Rs 1656 crore, from Rs11,794 to Rs 13,450 crore.

CPWD's earlier application to amend the terms of reference (TOR) for the project to add several new components of construction was rejected by EAC because CPWD was seeking clearances in a piecemeal manner.

EAC observed in the minutes of its meeting published on November 25 that CPWD should refrain from the piecemeal approach for the proposed development and redevelopment of the projects under Central Vista. The TOR is essentially the scope of the project. The grant of TOR is the initial clearance needed for any development project.

But independent experts have pointed out that the new proposal which was discussed by EAC on Wednesday for grant of TOR continues to be piecemeal and lacks transparency.

Union affairs minister Hardeep Puri, in charge of CPWD, did not respond for comment.

Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said: 'The application has once again just been pieced together in a shallow and casual manner. There is no explanation on why some parts like the Prime Minister's Office have been removed, whether there will be a separate application and why the costs of the project have gone up.'

CPWD officials didn't comment on why the PM's office complex is not mentioned in the revised proposal.

'The matter came to us today and it was discussed but the decision will be finalised and released in the minutes,' said T Haque, chairman of the EAC

The new Parliament building, which has already been granted environmental clearance (this is being challenged in the Supreme Court), the New India garden, the underground transit, the PM's office were all part of the central vista redevelopment project.

Experts say that none of this is reflected in the revised proposal submitted by the CPWD. Anuj Srivastava, spokesperson of LokPATH, (People for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts and civil society members, said: 'Why are they in a rush? Instead of deliberating and discussing this plan in detail, the government is hurriedly getting approval. Our main objection is to their piecemeal approach. There is no transparency in the way the project is being executed.'

Urban planners, environmental researchers and activists said CPWD had already tweaked its Central Vista proposal several times.

In November, CPWD submitted a conceptual plan for redeveloping the common central secretariat buildings and central conference centre along with the Prime Minister's office and residence, a Special Protection Group building and the Vice-President's enclave. The amendment application was made only a day after the environment ministry granted the TOR based on CPWD's initial proposal to redevelop only the common central secretariat and central conference centre.

In its latest proposal, CPWD said the total built-up area will be 17,21,500 sq m and area to be demolished 4,58,820 sq m and that the project is coming up over a total plot area admeasuring 5,48,776 sq m.

Experts said the demolition itself will have a massive impact on air quality and public health. 'Even from this partial disclosure and information available through media reports it is evident that the project will involve massive demolition and digging activity including that for the underground transit and basements. The application does not even consider it necessary to disclose whether alternatives have been examined, which is a mandatory requirement. Does this mean that there is no other way around uprooting hundreds of trees, diverting already scarce water resources for construction and curtailment of public space to accommodate central government office infrastructure? At present there are no studies to show if this has even been considered,' said Kohli.",Central Vista green approval: Consolidated plan submitted | Latest News Delhi - Hindustan Times,12,2020

The official said that the NDMC has convened a special meeting on September 7 with the objective of renaming the stretch.

In this year's Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra had stressed the abolition of symbols relating to the colonial mindset.

Rajpath was known as Kingsway during British Rule.

In the run-up to 2047, the PM has also stressed upon the importance of duties. Both these factors can be seen behind the naming of 'Kartavya Path'.

With the latest move, the entire road and area from the Netaji statue to the Rashtrapati Bhavan will be known as Kartavya Path, the official said.

Earlier, as per the ethos of the Modi government to make nomenclature more people-centric, the name of the road on which the PM's residence is located was also changed from Race Course Road to Lok Kalyan Marg.

Central Vista Avenue may open for public this week

Modi is likely to inaugurate the revamped Central Vista Avenue stretching from the Vijay Chowk to the India Gate on Thursday, reports suggest.

Considered to be the most popular public space in the city, the redeveloped stretch has red granite walkways spreading around 1.1 lakh square metre with greenery all around, more than 133 light poles along the Rajpath, 4,087 trees, 114 modern signages and stepped gardens.

This is the first project that has been completed under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.

""The work is over. The prime minister is likely to inaugurate the revamped avenue on September 8,"" news agency PTI quoted an official as saying.

According to an official document, there are more than 900 light poles, including those in the gardens and along the Rajpath between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate, a move aimed at making the Central Vista more pedestrian-friendly round the clock.

'The people mover will be accessible from the Central Secretariat Metro Station's concourse level, which is an interchange for the Yellow and Violet lines. The people mover will be connected to the Central Secretariat buildings in the basement,' said Bimal Patel, head of HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, the consultant and architect for the Central Vista redevelopment project.

A people mover is a small scale transit system mainly used to serve a small area such as airports and parks. The feasibility study for the underground transit project has been done, said HCP Design. The people mover will have coaches and run on electricity just like the Metro, but the technology it will run on is yet to be worked out by Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the government's construction arm, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).

The two are also working on the alignment, technology and the construction details, said the consultant. CPWD and DMRC officials declined comment.

Under the Central Vista project, a common Central Secretariat, a new Parliament House building, and residences of Prime Minister and vice-president will be constructed. The new Parliament building will be ready by 2022. A portion of the new Central Secretariat, which will house offices of all central ministries, will be completed by 2023.

The deadline for completion of the entire project is 2024.

The people mover, a 3-km-long (approximately) underground transit facility was initially meant to connect to two Metro stations -- Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhawan but the latter was found to be infeasible as it is not an interchange station and its distance from the proposed people mover corridor is an issue.

While the people mover will connect all 10 buildings in the new Central Secretariat, which will house 51 ministries, it will not be connected to the new Parliament building.

The Central Secretariat metro station is one of the major interchange stations on DMRC's network. The station provides interchange between the Yellow (Samaypur Badhi-HUDA city centre) and Violet (Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh (Ballabhgarh) lines.

The 38-km-long Yellow line is the busiest and carried an average of 1.45 million people a day before the pandemic.

The people mover will have four stations  one for every cluster of three buildings of the Central Secretariat.

'The buildings will be connected by an underground people mover and by an overground shuttle. These facilities will make the Central Secretariat a transit-oriented development. The plan is under development and will be finalised in coordination with all other projects being developed as part of the Central Vista Redevelopment,' said Patel.

The cluster of three buildings will be connected to the station by a walkway with travellators in the basement to ensure safe, secure and seamless movement of people.

Traffic volume in the Central Vista area will increase once the redevelopment project is complete. Connectivity to the Metro is essential because 44% of people currently working in various offices in the Central Vista use it, according to a survey conducted by HCP. Apart from the people mover, the capacity of roads will also be increased.

HCP wants to increase this proportion to 50% , which is where the people mover comes in. As for the traffic, according to HCP, it will be 'be managed by providing increased road capacities, dedicated access lanes and better entry and exit to the Central Secretariat. The Central Secretariat is being planned to provide parking for visitors to avoid on-street parking prevalent today. There will be dedicated bus bays and taxi bays...'

Amit Bhatt, director transport at WRI India, said the people mover 'is a good idea, but its success will depend on its integration with the existing transit system, including payment modes. Apart from providing alternative modes of public transport, it is important to put in place mechanisms to discourage the use of private vehicles...

The remaining 63 crore has been spent on the Central Vista Avenue, being redeveloped at an estimated cost of 608 crore, it added.

The government response was to a question by Rajya Sabha members G C Chandrashekhar and Rajmani Patel, who wanted to know the total estimated cost of the Central Vista redevelopment project and the expected number of years to complete it. They also wanted to know the cost of demolition of old structures and the estimated costs to be incurred on the Central Vista redevelopment project for the financial year 2021-22.

Minister of state of housing and urban affairs Kaushal Kishore said, 'Under the Central Vista Redevelopment/ Development Master Plan, only 2 projects viz. construction of New Parliament Building and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue are being implemented, as on date.' The minister added that the estimated expenditure on these two projects over financial year 2021-2022 was 1,289 crore.

He added that the estimated cost of razing down existing structures 'has not been worked out separately.'

Regarding the time taken for completion, the minister said the Central Vista Avenue was to be completed by November this year while the new parliament building will be completed in October next year.

While the government mentioned the cost of two specific projects, the revamp of the Rajpath and associated new constructions in the area will see the establishment of a new SPG (special protection group) building, vice president's enclave, Central conference center, ten common secretariat buildings and an automated people mover which will serve as a transit system to ferry employees to these ten secretariat buildings during peak hours. The total cost for these projects is estimated to be nearly 13,500 crore, as estimated by the Central Public Works Department.

As per the documents accessed by HT in the past, the vice president's new office and the new parliament building will be the first structures to be completed while all the others are scheduled to be completed by December 2026.

Earlier, HT had also reported that currently, the completion schedules are finalised only for the Central Vista Avenue which comprises Rajpath, leading from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate  and the new Parliament.

Also, according to a proposal given to the environment ministry in 2020, nearly 458,820 square metre of the built-up area will be razed down. These structures include the building housing Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) which sits on almost 25 acres of land. Besides INGCA, Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, vice-president's residence, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan, and INS Hutments will also be demolished.",��301cr spent on New Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue till date | Latest News India - Hindustan Times,8,2021

The project was initiated by the Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) in which each flat will be constructed over an area of 3,200 square feet and comprise four bedrooms, ANI quoted Housing Board official as saying.

This came at a time when Congress and other Opposition parties launched attacks on the central government over the construction of the Central Vista project amid Covid-19 pandemic.

The top court upheld the environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for the project, which covers a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, by 2:1 majority, held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for the project was valid. Justice Khanwilkar, writing the judgement for himself and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, also directed that the project proponent set up smog tower and use anti-smog guns at the construction site for the Central Vista project.

Here's a 10-point guide on the revamped Parliament of India  the Central Vista:

- The Central Vista revamp, announced in September, 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project.

- The top court's verdict came on several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use On December 7, last year the top court had allowed the Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project on December 10 after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue.

- Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building and the construction is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore.

- The apex court had earlier said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be 'at their own risk"". It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

- The Centre had argued in the top court that the project would 'save money"" which is paid as rent for housing central government ministries in the national capital. It had submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.

- The Shram Shakti Bhavan and Transport Bhavan in Lutyens' Delhi will be the first two buildings to be razed to pave the way for the construction of chambers of Members of Parliament there as part of Central Vista redevelopment project.

- In the new Parliament building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members.

- The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building. According to the plan, a tunnel would be constructed to connect the building with chambers of MPs in the Parliament complex.

- 'The new Parliament will have six committee rooms to conduct business,"" an official from HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, said. The government has identified around four locations  in Gole Market, K G Marg, near Africa Avenue and near Talkatora Stadium  in central Delhi for the temporary shifting of offices of various ministries.

- Government sources said that the demolition of buildings will be carried out in phases to ensure smooth functioning of various ministry offices. To construct Common Central Secretariat for ministry offices, several buildings like Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan among others are likely to be demolished.

- The redevelopment project of Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. According to the CPWD's latest proposal for the redevelopment of Central Vista, the prime minister's new residential complex will have 10 four-storey buildings with a maximum height of 12 metres.

- The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore. The prime minister's new residence will be built on a 15-acre plot and it will have 10 buildings and they will have ground plus three floors, the CPWD said in its proposal.

A bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice Aniruddha Bose, did not agree to the submission that the project in Lutyens' Delhi needed to be stayed as the government bodies were to approach the authorities concerned for clearance and other formalities.

""Nobody is going to do anything"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, said the bench.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said a new parliament building is being constructed and wondered as to why anybody should have objection to this.

""Shikhil Suri, counsel appearing for the petitioner prays for withdrawal of this petition with liberty to amend the writ petition...which has been transferred to this court from the High Court. Prayer is allowed. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty aforesaid,"" the apex court said in its order.

Another plea related to the project, filed by the same petitioner, is pending with the top court which refused to entertain the fresh plea.

The earlier plea was against the Delhi High Court order which had said that the DDA was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

Several new government buildings besides a new Parliament House are part of the project.

A division bench of the High Court on February 28 had stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the Delhi Development Authority to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The HC's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The division bench of the High Court had also issued notice to the two individuals -- Rajeev Suri and Lt Col (retd) Anuj Srivastava -- on whose pleas the February 11 order was passed, and had listed the Centre and DDA's appeals for further hearing on May 6.

Suri and Srivastava, in their pleas before the single judge, have opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

They have contended that DDA does not have the power to bring about the proposed change in land use and master plan and only the central government can do so.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The government has been facing criticism from the opposition for executing the Central Vista Redevelopment Project amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Slamming the opposition, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had on Monday said a false narrative is being created over the Central Vista redevelopment plan and asserted that it is not a ""vanity project"", but a necessity. Under the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue which comprises Rajpath, leading from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, 48 trees are proposed to be transplanted and of them, permission has been granted for 25, including 22 Jamun trees, till date, sources said.

However, no old tree planted as per Lutyen's original plan, including Jamun trees, is proposed to be transplanted, they said. Transplantation of the trees approved is in progress, they said. On Sunday, the government sought to bust ""myths"" around the Central Vista project, saying that all laid down procedures have been followed.

""The cost for the PM's residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media. It is part of many projects, as mentioned earlier, whose neither the design has been approved nor the cost estimate or tendered cost has been firmed up,"" they said. Detailed environment impact assessment has been carried out for all the 10 Buildings under the Common Central Secretariat, Common Conferencing facility, Prime Minister's Residence, Prime Minister's Office and Vice President Enclave.

""The Expert Appraisal Committee which is an independent body of field experts has examined this and recommended for clearance on May 2 this year. Environmental Clearance has been granted by MoEF&CC on May 31. ""Therefore, these statements that piecemeal approach has been taken to surmise adverse impact of this project is unfound and totally false,"" they said.

The Congress has been asking the BJP-led Union government to shelve its plans on the central vista redevelopment project and give priority to improving medical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic to save people's lives. The government said that all the paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, collections and other significant heritage and cultural artefacts that are presently housed at the National Museum, National Archives of India and Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) are carefully preserved.

According to the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the entire project will be carried out in a heritage-sensitive manner. The existing documents and artefacts will be moved to upgraded facilities, with modern infrastructure, to ensure their longevity, it has said. The entire exercise will be spearheaded and monitored by the Ministry of Culture, ensuring compliance to the heritage conservation guidelines.

All the relevant heritage-sensitive approvals and clearances will be obtained from Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) before initiating the project, it has said.

The signatories included former IAS officers Jawhar Sircar, Jawed Usmani, NC Saxena, Aruna Roy, Harsh Mander and Rahul Khullar, and former IPS officers AS Dulat, Amitabh Mathur and Julio Ribeiro. ""Notwithstanding the specious reasoning as to why a new Parliament building is at all necessary, it is a matter of great dismay that at a time when we are faced with an economy in perilous decline and a pandemic which has brought untold misery to millions, the government has chosen to invest vast sums on a project which represents nothing but the pursuit of pomp and grandeur,"" they said.

""Of particular concern is the manner in which environmental clearances were obtained for a plan which treats the green spaces and the built heritage of the central vista as an unnecessary hurdle to the achievement of objectives driven by monumental ambition,"" it further alleged.

The former civil servants also wondered what locus standi the prime minister has to lay the foundation stone of the Parliament building. ""The prime minister is the head of the executive, not of the legislature. For a building that will accommodate the two Houses of Parliament, the appropriate protocol would have been for the President of India to lay the foundation stone.

Although temporary bridges on water bodies along the Rajpath have been set up as part of the Republic Day parade arrangements, a total of 16 permanent ones will come up.

According to an official document, eight amenity blocks are being constructed while four pedestrian underpasses will come up in the entire stretch. It shows that on the developed stretch, 'Tree Avenue' has 4,087 trees, but the earlier number was 3,890. The stretch also sports 422 red granite benches.

Along the Rajpath, the new red granite walkways spreading 1,10,457 sqm have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier. As many as 987 concrete bollards have been installed on the Rajpath. A total of 1,490 modern-look manholes have replaced the earlier ones.

On January 11, Puri had said the recent record rainfall had delayed the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project by a day or two, but not more. Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km Rajpath, a new prime minister's residence and prime minister's office, and a new vice president's enclave.

The minster said this on the sidelines of an event here. This is the first official reaction by the minister on the ambitious plan of the Narendra Modi government.

Under its mega plan to redevelop the over three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi, the Modi government has floated a request for proposal for the ""development or redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista.""

Asked about the site and design of the Parliament Building, Puri said these aspects are currently ""under consideration"".

""As of now, the timeline is expected that by mid-October we should be able to float tender (for the design) and by next year the construction may begin. But, these are all tentative,"" he told reporters.

Earlier in his address, he spoke about the prime minister's ""dream project"" of redeveloping the prime government complex spread from Raisina Hill to India Gate, including the North Block and South Block, and Parliament complex.

""The North Block and South Block and the 3.5-km Central Vista spreading from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, all of that will be redeveloped,"" he said.

""And, by 2024 at the time of the next elections, it is expected that we will be in a new Parliament Building,"" Puri said.

The Monsoon Session of Parliament in 2022 will be held in a newly-developed Parliament Building, government sources said on Thursday.

The sources said that by next year, the Central Vista will be redeveloped and the common Central Secretariat will be built by 2024.

Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan are among buildings which may be razed to facilitate a common Central Secretariat for offices of various ministries, sources also said on Thursday.

""Nirman Bhawan, Shahstri Bhawan and other such buildings, they will all be rebuilt,"" Puri said.

Asked if the look of the old Parliament building, a Grade-I Heritage structure, will be changed, he said, ""It is a heritage building, and therefore its facade cannot be touched"".

Rashtrapati Bhavan (built as Viceroy's House), Parliament House, North Block and South Block, and Central Vista leading to India Gate are some of the most iconic buildings of the city which were constructed between 1911-1931, during the building of India's new capital, 'New Delhi'.

The work had begun after the capital of the British India was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi at a Coronation Durbar held here in December 1911.

Sir Edwin Lutyens was made the main architect of the city and he was also assisted by Sir Herbert Baker, in designing the North Block, South Block and Parliament House. Construction of Parliament House, built in an iconic circular design began in 1921 and Viceroy Lord Irwin had inaugurated it in 1927. He had inaugurated the capital of New Delhi in 1931, by which time the buildings on Raisina Hill were completed.

""It is prime minister's dream project. Most of these buildings came up from 1911-1927, and they are very imposing. But, those made after Independence, some of these seem to have been built in a hurry, and may have outlived their purpose,"" Puri said.

""Also, many of the post-Independence buildings are not earthquake-resistant ,and cost us on repairs. Also, the government spends about Rs 1,000 cr every year on renting facilities for government offices,"" Puri said.

Asked the reason behind the revamp of Parliament, he said both Houses  Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are located in it and their strength may increase after delimitation.

""Also MPs have no rooms, no facility for research back-up and for working with their officials,"" the Union minister said, adding, ""So, at this time, we are working in a world of ideas, and suggestion are also coming for a new Parliament building nearby the existing one, in an open space, but these are all ideas at the moment."" Sources on Thursday had said that the existing Parliament building might be turned into a museum, if the Centre decides to build a new one.","Work on Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Central Vista May Begin by Next Year, Says Hardeep Singh Puri",9,2019

This came after the Congress and other Opposition parties heavily criticised the Centre about the money being spent on the project instead of upgrading the healthcare system in the country.

On Oppositions' claim that an amount of Rs 20,000 crore is being spent on the Central Vista Project this year during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in an official release as reported by NDTV said, 'The Redevelopment of Central Vista Master Plan was conceived in September 2019, many months earlier than the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in March 2021. The Central Vista development/redevelopment plan is a generational infrastructure investment project, involving multiple projects spread over 6 years.""

'Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost Rs 862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost Rs 477 crore have been awarded and works are underway. Expenditure incurred on these 2 projects till March 2021 is Rs 195 crore and budget provision for 2021-22 is Rs 790 crore,"" the ministry said.

The government also busted the myth that the project is contributing to environmental damage, along with reduction of green spaces in the area.

'The projects will result in overall increase in green cover. No trees will be cut in any projects in Central Vista. Strict measures are also being undertaken simultaneously to minimise environmental effects of the Central Vista project, during the contruction phase,"" the government said.

On claim that the Central Vista project is leading to a destruction of its Architectural Heritage, the Centre said, 'None of the listed Heritage buildings in Central Vista (India Gate, Parliament, North and South Blocks, National Archives or any other) will be demolished.""

The central government also rubbished the claims that Rs 13,450 crore is being incurred on new house for Prime Minister. 'the estimate of Rs 13,450 crore was mentioned as a gross rough estimate of all buildings in the application for environmental clearance to MoEF&CC. This includes multiple projects, including 10 buildings of the Common Central Secretariat, Executive Enclave, Central Conference Centre and the official residence of VP and PM of India. These have not been approved yet,"" the government explained.

'The cost for the PM's residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media,"" it added.

Earlier in the day, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had hit out at the Congress for opposing the Centra Vista Avenue redevelopment and new Parliament building projects, and accused its government in Rajasthan of constructing 160 'luxurious houses"" for MLAs at a cost of Rs 266 crore. The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister alleged that building bylaws have been flouted by the Rajasthan government for constructing the 'luxurious houses"" for the legislators.

Last month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had attacked the Union government over the central vista redevelopment project, terming it a 'criminal wastage"" and asked the dispensation to focus on people's lives amid the raging coronavirus pandemic. 'Congress opposed ongoing work on Central Vista Avenue & new Parliament but its govt begins work on 160 luxurious houses for Rajasthan MLAs for ?266 cr. Building bylaws flouted. 28 mtr tall building allowed as a special case against a 15 mtr rule. Special Case of Hypocrisy!,"" Puri tweeted Saturday.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the power corridor of the country  envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president. The Congress has been asking the BJP-led Union government to shelve its plans on the central vista redevelopment project and give priority to improving medical infrastructure during the Covid-19 pandemic to save people's lives.

In the revised budget of 2019-20, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), a prime construction agency of the Union government, had been given Rs 1,135.72 crore.

In the 2020-21 budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Lok Sabha on Saturday, the agency has been given Rs 3,033.41 crore.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate.

According to an official, the CPWD has estimated that the redevelopment of Central Vista will cost around Rs 12,879 crore.

The triangular Parliament building is targeted to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.

Under the project, the prime minister's residence and office are likely to be shifted near the South Block and the vice-president's new house will be in the vicinity of the North Block.

""The residence and office of the prime minister will be close enough so that the prime minister can walk to office from home,"" a source had said last month.

The common Central Secretariat will comprise 10 buildings, five on each side of Central Vista. Each building will have eight floors, which will house various ministries.

There are currently around 25,000 to 32,000 employees working in various ministries situated in different locations in the Lutyens' Delhi.

A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, which was hearing the petitions raising questions over several aspects, including the environmental clearance (EC) granted to the project, said the allegations regarding change of land use is the threshold issue.

""We make it clear that the court will first begin with the hearing of broad issue regarding challenge to the change of land use being contrary to the provisions of Delhi Development Act, 1957,"" said the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna.

The apex court said the broad issues raised in the pleas pending before it are  allegations regarding change of land use, alleged violation of statutory and municipal laws, issues regarding EC and other aspects.

""For the sake of convenience, a draft flow chart has been prepared by the office indicating the heads of broad issues in different petitions filed and listed so far for hearing and, in particular, referring to the specific 5 notifications/notices challenged therein,"" the bench noted in its order. ""The parties are free to give suggestions to improve upon or modify the flow chart on the next date of hearing,"" the apex court said and posted the matter for hearing on August 25.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, questioned the challenge made in the pleas to the project which includes construction of new parliament building. The top court had last month allowed filing of a fresh plea challenging the June 17 environment clearance granted to the project for constructing a new Parliament House and other government buildings.

The bench is hearing several pleas on the issue, including those filed by activist Rajeev Suri and retired Lt Col. Anuj Srivastava against various permissions given to the project by the authorities including the nod to change of land use. Earlier, the apex court had said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be ""at their own risk"".

It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision. The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.

One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project. The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre. The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista. The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

'The top court never thought the Centre will go ahead aggressively with construction due to pandemic. We though we are dealing with a prudent litigant and deference will be shown,' the court observed.

The SC clarified that the fact that there is no stay doesn't mean construction can go on. 'You can lay the foundation stone, you can carry on paperwork but no construction or demolition, no cutting down any trees,"" the Supreme Court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.

'I can assure the court that only foundation stone will be laid. No trees will be cut, or physical changed to the structure will be done. I can make that statement,' Mehta responded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building on December 10. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore.

The new building will be earthquake resistant and 2,000 people will be directly involved in the construction of the new building and 9,000 indirectly. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan.

The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said. He said the invitation will be extended to all political parties. While some would attend physically and others would attend virtually, Birla said, while adding that the ceremony would follow Covid-related guidelines.

The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members.

This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses. At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.

In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project. The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.

The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has 12 gates.

'Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years.

Puri came down heavily on what he called the Congress's 'hypocrisy' and said 'Congress leaders wrote about the need for a new parliament' during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)'s rule at the Centre.

'The Speaker in 2012 wrote a letter to Urban Development Ministry for the same. And now they have the gall to oppose the same project?'

'While Central Vista is not new, see Congress' hypocrisy. Congress & its allies are splurging on a new project reconstructing an MLA hostel in Maharashtra & building a new Legislative Assembly building in Chhattisgarh. If this is fine, what is the problem with Central Vista?' Puri said in another tweet.

The Union minister also accused the Congress of practising 'cheap politics' and adopting a diversion tactic. 'They want to distract people from monumental governance failures in their states by spreading lies. So they indulge in cheap politics despite knowing this project creates direct & indirect employment for thousands of skilled, semi-skilled & unskilled workers in these times,' he posted.

The Central Vista project envisages the construction of a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice President, and several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate ministries' offices.

Puri's offensive came hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi termed the project a 'criminal wastage'. 'Central Vista is criminal wastage. Put people's lives at the centre  not your blind arrogance to get a new house,' Gandhi posted on Twitter.

Puri pointed out that there were hundreds of projects being executed by various departments. 'Governance hasn't come to a standstill, unlike the Congress's times of policy paralysis. Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It's only the Congress that's obsessed about it, nobody else,' he said, taking a dig at past governments led by the Congress at the Centre.

'Moreover, only projects for New Parliament Building & rejuvenation of Central Vista Avenue have been awarded at an estimated cost of 862 crore & 477 crore respectively till now. As I said, there are many components in Central Vista project which are spread over several years,' Puri added.

In a related development, the Supreme Court refused on Friday to entertain a plea against deferment of hearing on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking direction to halt construction activities under the Central Vista project during the pandemic, but gave liberty to petitioners to approach the Delhi High Court for urgent listing of the matter.

The court was hearing the appeal against a May 4 order of the high court, which had listed the PIL for hearing on May 17 while mention that it wanted to first go through what the Supreme Court deliberated in its January 5 judgment that gave a go-ahead to the ambitious project, news agency PTI reported.

A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheswari and Sanjiv Khanna allowed senior advocate Shyam Divan to file within a week a fresh plea challenging the EC by the '�Central Vista Committee' to the project.

The central government will respond to the petition a week after it is filed. The top court, which posted the petition to be filed for hearing in the week commencing August 17, said however that it was not sure whether physical hearing would commence by then. It has been holding hearing via video conferencing since the COVID-19 lockdown in March.

""We permit a week to Divan to file the petition and a week to Centre to reply within a week of receiving the plea Matter to be posted after two weeks,"" the bench ordered.

The bench was hearing as many as seven pleas, including two transfer petitions from the Delhi High Court, on the issue and they have been filed by persons like activist Rajeev Suri and retired Lt Col. Anuj Srivastava against various permissions given to the project by the authorities, including the nod to change the land use.

At the outset, Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, said the case was primarily against the permission on change of the land use and then ""there was an environmental clearance granted on June 17 to the project"".

He said there were multiple causes of action and the grant of the EC can be challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the apex court cannot use its power to curtail that challenge to the EC before the NGT.

The bench said that there were two other petitions which raised the environmental issues and the fresh plea on EC will be governed by the orders of the apex court only. Lawyer Shikhil Suri, appearing for Suri, said that one of the pending petitions challenged the grant of EC to the parliament project only, but now the issue of grant of EC to entire Central Vista project has come up.

""There is no 'We versus They' here. Our parliament is being constructed. In future also defence and finance ministry buildings will be constructed,"" said Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, adding that ""private individuals"" are before the court as also the ""public spirited individuals"".

""The project has to go through every level of scrutiny that a citizen can invoke. The clearance granted was for the construction of new and renovation of the existing parliament building,'� Divan said.

Opposing the grant of the EC, Divan said a piecemeal approach was adopted and the entire central vista project was needed to be registered as a township project and then the EC should have been granted.

Recently, the CPWD has supported the the project and sought dismissal of the pleas challenging it. Earlier, the apex court had said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be ""at their own risk"".

It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision. The pleas have challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.

One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre. The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the entire stretch from Vijay Chowk to India Gate in the evening on September 8 under his government ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, officials in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said.

The stretch will open for public after 20 months. On the day of inauguration, visitors will not be allowed on the stretch from the India Gate to Man Singh Road, but they can use the remaining part. From September 9, the entire stretch will be thrown open to the general public. The CPWD, an executing agency of the project, has set up five vending zones where 40 vendors each will be allowed and according to the plan, they will not be allowed to sell their items to visitors in the garden area.

A senior official said there would be two blocks near the India Gate and each block has eight shops, adding that some states have shown their interest to set up their food stalls. 'Ice cream carts will only be allowed in the vending zones. Although we have not taken any decision, we will ensure that these ice cream trolleys are not allowed along roads,"" the official said.

The official said there would be heavy deployment of police personnel and security guards to ensure that there is no theft and damage to newly-installed facilities. Around 80 security guards will keep an eye on the stretch. He said that 19 acres of total canal area have been revamped. They have been fitted with infrastructure such as aerators. There are 16 bridges on the entire stretch. Boating will be allowed in two canals  one near Krishi Bhawan and another one around Vanijya Bhawan.

He said maintaining cleanliness will be a challenge as people in a large number will throng the Rajpath, which is considered as the most popular public space in the city. 'We appealed to people to maintain cleanliness. Large teams of sanitation workers will be deployed,"" the official said.

Along the Rajpath, the area spreading 3.90 lakh square metre has been developed with greenery all around. Also, the new red granite walkways spreading 15.5 km have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier. Another official said that parking space for 1,125 vehicles have been created in the entire stretch. A parking space for 35 buses have been created near the India Gate.

Seventy-four historic light poles and all chain links have been restored. Over 900 new light poles have been installed.

The government, however, has planned to hold the 2022 Republic Day parade on the newly-developed Rajpath that comes under the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project.

In a written reply to a question by Congress MP Manish Tewari, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore said the new Parliament building project, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2022, has achieved 35 per cent of physical progress.

At the inaugural ceremony of two office complexes for the employees of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces here on September 16, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the Winter Session of Parliament next year would take place in the new Parliament building.

Addressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event, he had said, ""I would like to assure you that the redevelopment work of Central Vista Avenue will be completed in two-and-a-half months, where the Republic Day parade will be held.""

In his written reply to Tewari, Kishore said Rs 1,289 crore has been allocated for the development/redevelopment works of Central Vista in the ongoing financial year.

The minister said these works have provided direct livelihood opportunities to more than 10,000 skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers on site and off site and generated more than 24.12 lakh man days of employment. In addition, substantial employment in manufacturing and transportation of cement, steel and other building materials have been provided, Kishore said, adding these works will also contribute to the economy and help realize our resolve for ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"".

He also said that there is no link between works pertaining to Central Vista and Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). ""Separately, the Union cabinet, in its meeting on November 10, has restored MPLADS for the remaining part of the Financial Year 2021-22 and its continuation from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26 with an outlay of Rs 17,417 crore,"" he said.

In the last 17 years, ruling dispensations have made at least three attempts to set up a new parliament building: in 2002 under late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 2015 by the-then Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, and last week, when the pitch finally received the government's go-ahead. It's probably just a coincidence that the proposals for a new building have always come when the BJP  a party seen as a proponent of faith-based systems such as astrology, numerology and vastu  has been in power. Some opposition leaders suspect a 'vastu' or 'feng shui' inspiration behind the move to effect major structural changes to the Parliament House or construct a new building.

In 2002, a practitioner hired by the-then Speaker found serious vastu flaws and suggested some structural alterations, or converting the Parliament Annexe or Vigyan Bhavan, both vastu-friendly, into a parliament house. Another option was constructing a brand new structure.

It is true that the Parliament House requires more space, and needs repairs and renovation due to wear and tear. But the proposed move at the cost of taxpayers' money, especially when the economy has been hit by a downturn, has raised eyebrows in political circles.

While many were guarded, former Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav said the government's priorities were misplaced. 'Having served 11 terms as Member of Parliament, I feel it my duty to say that I am not in favour of proposal to build a new parliament house building,' he tweeted last week. 'Yes it can be renovated or strengthened. These buildings are beauty of Lutyens Delhi & part of Indian heritage & history.""

On 12 September, union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri announced that the Centre will reconstruct areas around Rajpath, which includes a new parliament building to reflect India's own architecture. These iconic buildings were erected between 1911 and 1931, around the time the new capital was inaugurated. Speaking at a FICCI event, Puri said reconstruction of the central vista 'was Prime Minister's dream project'. According to media reports, the government has set July 2022, ahead of the 75th Independence Day, as the target date for a new parliament building or a major revamp of the existing structure.

That the Indian Parliament building suffered from 'vastu dosha' (flaws of the elements) was discovered by then Speaker Manohar Joshi in 2002. Joshi's fear was spurred by the deaths of 13 MPs, including Speaker GM Balayogi in a helicopter crash, and the terrorist attack on Parliament a year earlier. After taking Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee into confidence, Joshi hired the services of a vastu expert, Ashwinie Kumar Bansal, to ascertain the 'doshas' and suggest remedies. Bansal made two visits to the Parliament House, found 'serious flaws' and handed a detailed report to Joshi. But it was kept under wraps fearing backlash from the Left-liberal sections of the political class, who consider vastu 'mumbo jumbo'.

Bansal's report, among other things, said that the 'string of tragedies, friction inside the House between members and political parties, and the inability of the political leadership to make the right decisions to take the country forward, are the results of negative energy emanating from the building'.

The vastu expert claimed that the trouble with the Parliament building 'begins from its circular shape itself, which is good for a stadium but not for a legislature. The Gandhi statue (erected in 1993) aggravated the bad effects'. He suggested barricading the area around it and putting up water fountains to absorb the negative energy. Conceptualised by Herbert Baker, the 92-year-old circular structure comprises three semi-circular chambers for the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and the Central Hall crowned by a high dome.

Bansal also faulted the seating arrangement inside the House saying that 'the Lok Sabha chamber is shaped like a 'D', which is not good in vastu. The PM sits in the northwest, the zone of air and air has the quality of movement which creates pressure'. The PM should sit in the middle, he suggested. The Speaker's chair is right under the press gallery and that is why the presiding officer is unable to control the members, he said.

Two years later, when the UPA 1 government took office and veteran Marxist leader Somnath Chatterjee became the Speaker, the vastu report was quietly junked. But in 2009, his successor Meira Kumar revisited the issue, not from the point of view of vastu, but 'safety' of the building due to wear and tear.

She constituted a parliamentary committee comprising leaders of major political parties and domain experts to examine the proposals for renovation, alteration, modification or constructing a new complex. However, the move did not resonate with many lawmakers, including parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who felt the huge cost to the exchequer was unwarranted. Interestingly, in July the Telangana High Court, hearing a clutch of petitions, stalled chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao's plan to demolish the secretariat building  that he felt is not vastu-compliant  and construct a new complex at a cost of Rs 500 crore even as the state has been reeling under severe agrarian crisis with nearly 4,000 farmers reportedly committing suicide in the last four years.

What the central government eventually does remains to be seen. And only time will tell whether recurring turmoil in Indian Parliament can be healed by exorcising any resident demons with vastu shastra.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the power corridor of the country  includes the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. It also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a Common Central Secretariat and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

Responding to a question in Lok Sabha on the relocation of trees to the Badarpur Eco-Park, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said according to information received from the Central Public Works Department, ""only 22 number of trees have been relocated from the Central Vista Avenue to the eco-park, Badarpur, and there is no other proposal to relocate trees from the Central Vista Avenue to Badarpur"". He said there is a proposal to plant 10 saplings for every tree uprooted or removed, and the compensatory plantation will be done at the Badarpur Eco-Park, Badarpur.

On another query on census of trees, Yadav said, ""As per available information, no tree census has been conducted in the recent past."" ""However, the Forest Survey of India (FSI) carries out sample plot based regular inventory of trees in forests and outside forests in the country under its National Forest Inventory Programme,"" he said. On the basis of data collected growing stock  stems and volume of wood  estimates are generated at the national and state levels, he told Lok Sabha in a written response. To a question about the survival rates of relocated trees and details of existing and ongoing research that supports relocation, Yadav said the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun, had conducted a study on tree translocation in India last year and it has submitted a report to the ministry. ""There is no further ongoing study under the ICFRE at present in this regard,"" he said. The Centre had earlier rubbished reports that several jamun trees, nearly 100 years old, could be uprooted as a part of the Central Vista project, and had claimed that the overall green cover will increase.

In May, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had said that only a few trees will be transplanted as part of the project. The environment ministry has already granted clearance for expansion and renovation of the existing Parliament building, which is a part of the Rs 13,450 crore Central Vista redevelopment project. The construction of the prime minister's residence under the ambitious project will be completed by December 2022, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had informed a central government appointed expert panel, which has given its nod to the project. The CPWD, the project developer, informed the expert appraisal committee (EAC) that the expansion of Parliament building and construction of new Parliament building will be done by November 2022 and prime minister's residence will be constructed by December 2022.

The top court has so far, thrice, refused to stay the project but made it clear that the validity of step taken will be subject to the outcome of the challenge to the project.

Mehta contended before the bench that the project fulfils contemporary needs, and insisted that the heritage buildings will be conserved, not demolished. Mehta argued: 'The present Parliament building will be there as it is. The ceremonies will be held in the central hall.""

Mehta submitted that for deciding that a new Parliament is needed, there is no need for a separate study. He added that the policy decision is that all central ministries will have to be at one place and also there is linkage through metro stations which will minimise use of two and four wheelers. 'We have to run around the city to go to different ministries increasing traffic and pollution,"" Mehta added.

He insisted that new building will save money. The DDA had informed the apex court that historical landmarks like the Rashtrapati Bhawan, the North and South Blocks, the Parliament House and the National Archives will be conserved.

The top court is hearing two petitions challenging the project and allege that there is an illegal change in land use and has urged the court to quash the project.

The plan for the project has been prepared in accordance with India's 75th Independence Day in 2022. The work on the Central Vista is slated for completion by November 2021.

The Central Vista houses iconic buildings like the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, and also the India Gate.

The Centre is proposing to redevelop by constructing a new parliament house, a new residential complex, which would house the Prime Minister and the Vice President, besides several new office buildings.

He said it is ""obscene"" that the government is going ahead with the project even now, referring to the country's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Ramesh's comments come in the backdrop the Centre approving the land use change for execution of the Central Vista redevelopment project in Lutyens' Delhi last week.

""It is not just insensitive, but obscene to be thinking of the New Central Vista project now. It should be put on hold indefinitely. There are more pressing uses for the thousands of crores that will be spent to satisfy one man's ego,"" the Congress leader said in a tweet.

He also shared a news report claiming that the project is likely to be delayed by a few weeks due to a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Over the past few days, several opposition leaders have criticised the government for notifying the land use change for the project.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath-from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

The new Parliament House building will come up on a 9.5-acre land near the existing building. Earlier, the plot was meant for development of a district park.",Central Vista Project Should be Put on Hold Indefinitely: Jairam Ramesh,3,2020

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.

The apex court was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential. The matter came up for hearing before a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar which asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Centre, to file a short affidavit on the issue.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the authorities have not demonstrated any public interest as far as the change in land use from recreational to residential for the plot is concerned. Mehta told the bench that official residences for the Vice-President and the Prime Minister are stipulated on the plot.

So, the public recreation area is not available now, the bench asked Mehta, adding, Is the public recreational area going to be transposed to some other place or transferred to some other plot. Mehta said the recreational area could be shifted but he also cited security concerns considering that Parliament would come up there.

What is your stand, we would like to know about it, the bench said. I will have to take instructions, Mehta said, adding, Considering that Parliament and other things would be coming up nearby, from a security point of view it would not be possible to have a recreational area in the vicinity.

The bench asked whether he would like to file a short affidavit on the limited point raised in the matter. Mehta said he would file an affidavit within three days. The respondents (Centre and others) may file short affidavit to deal with this contention within three days from today, including to justify the necessity of modification, the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on October 29.

In January this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid. The top court's verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.

The top court had in June this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID pandemic.

These three new buildings will come on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located. According to the bids for the transplantation of trees, there are 2,219 trees (approximately) on plot number 137, out of which 1,838 trees (approximately) are to be transplanted.

There are 1,150 trees having girth up to 50 cm, which will be transplanted, the bids stated, adding that there are also 401 trees which have girth beyond 50 cm and up to 90 cm. In bid documents, the CPWD said it is proposed to avoid cutting of trees to the maximum extent and instead transplant the affected trees, within the site or in the vicinity, in a phased manner.

The girth and height of the tree will be measured and recorded before the start of any activity, the CPWD said, adding that photographs of each tree before the start of the process of translocation will be submitted by the bidder. The tree will be geo-tagged before and after transplantation. ""Lifting of trees shall be carried out or supervised by a qualified and/or suitably experienced person and crane operator using a crane and supports. It shall be ensured that there is no damage to the soil ball or any scratching and splitting of the root system. The tree should be kept intact without injuries to its root system, trunk and crown,"" it stated.

The entire process of translocation will be video graphed and submitted fortnightly to the CPWD. Penalty of Rs 5,000 will be imposed if the agency fails to do so.

The top court had made it clear that fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, would depend on its decision.

The court was earlier told that two notifications have been issued, one regarding land-use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had told the top court that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The two petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted the work to be halted in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, observing that it was ""not a genuine public interest litigation"".

Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav Wednesday filed the petition in the apex court challenging the high court verdict. Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was not justified in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence.

It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a serious public health issue concern. It said the high court was not justified in holding that the construction activities for the project is essential activities, especially when the entire activities of service sector, industrial sector and the activities of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are fully suspended during the peak pandemic lockdown period. In its verdict, the high court had said, ""The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, which had been hearing a plea for suspending the ongoing construction work during the Covid pandemic, had fixed May 31 for delivery of its judgement on it, the high court's cause list revealed on Saturday.

The court had reserved its judgement on May 17 on the joint plea by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker.

The two had contended in their plea that the project was not an essential activity and can be put on hold for time being.

During the May 17 hearing, the Centre had termed the plea as a 'facade"" or a 'disguise"", aimed at stalling the project.

The petitioners on the other hand had contended they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area.

The petitioners' counsel had likened the project to 'Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, had also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workforce.

Terming the Central Vista project as 'central fortress of death"" and comparing it to 'Auschwitz"", the petitioners' counsel Sidharth Luthra had contended that the Centre's claim on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre and other amenities on the site were all false.

He had said only empty tents have been pitched at the site and there were no beds for workers to stay or sleep there.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, however, had taken strong exceptions to the project being dubbed as 'Auschwitz' and said 'one can criticise and be venomous"" about it but such terms should not be used in courtrooms.

Countering the petitioners' claims, the Centre's law officer had said one of the petitioners had been opposed to the project long before it got the go-ahead from the Supreme Court in January this year.

He said the petitioners were not concerned with the health and safety of workers at other construction sites in the city.

'Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) about the health of workmen,"" he had added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.

He had said the petitioners cannot decide what is the safe timeline for completing the project and the company has to finish it by November so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat to house offices of all ministries, the revamping of the three-kilometre-long Kartavya Path from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and office, and a new vice-president's enclave.

In its RFP document, the CPWD states the project has many components to be planned and executed in a phased manner. Project of this magnitude needs to be monitored in professional manner with latest management tools.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in the RFP document states that a need is felt that one project support unit is needed to be engaged which will assist the HUA ministry and the agency in monitoring of the projects and peer review of MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering) services.

'The objective of this document (RFP) is to seek professional expertise for the project of Central Vista to bring in synergies across various stakeholders towards successful completion of the project. To undertake this task, PSU will require appropriate technical personnel,"" it states.

The CPWD's document states that the 'technical personnel"" will also prepare weekly/monthly progress reports capturing progress of key activities and milestones, after physical inspection of under execution works once a week.

They will also flag schedule variances, roadblocks or any other risks affecting the overall timelines to senior officials of PSU and ministry, and suggest preventive and connective actions.

The 'technical personnel"" of PSU will assist in coordinating with all agencies  consultants, contractors, material and equipment suppliers, suppliers of long lead items  and to advise in ensuring that activities are progressing as planned, the RFP states.

The CPWD in the request for proposal said that project support unit or individual will not share or provide access to any information related to this project to any individual network or firm/company network system except to the authorised persons for reporting.

'PSU shall submit affidavit to maintain official secrecy on prescribed format on behalf of company and individual employed by the company. Violation to this shall attract punitive action as provided under Officials Secrets Act,"" the document states.

A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna will pronounce the verdict on the batch of pleas on which it had reserved its verdict on November 5, last year.

On December 7, last year the top court had allowed the Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project on December 10 after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue.

The Centre had told the bench that there would be only foundation stone-laying ceremony, and no construction, demolition or felling of trees would be done for the project as of now. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone on December 10, last year, for the new Parliament building and the construction is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had said on December 5, last year.

The apex court had earlier said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be 'at their own risk"". It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

On November 5, the apex court had reserved its verdict on a batch of pleas which have raised questions over the Centre's ambitious Central Vista project, which covers three km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

The Centre had earlier argued in the top court that the project would 'save money"" which is paid as rent for housing central government ministries in the national capital. It had submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.

The Centre had also said there was no arbitrariness or favouritism in selecting consultant for the project and the argument that the government could have adopted a better process cannot be a ground to scrap the project. Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the nod to change of land use. The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.

One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The stay order of the high court on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre. The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

In his written reply to a question by All India Trinamool Congress MP Mala Roy, Puri said, ""In the current economic scenario, the project shall generate large number of direct and indirect employment which could be an important fulcrum for economic revival."" Puri said that the estimated cost for construction of new Parliament building is Rs 971 crore. Estimated cost of other buildings and development and redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue will be worked out after finalisation of plans, Puri said.

Explaining the rationale behind the need of the project, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that the existing Parliament House building was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927 and hence, the building is already 93 years old, adding that its facilities and amenities are ""highly inadequate"". ""There is acute shortage of office space and there are no individual chambers for Members of Parliament. This building was not meant to be for bicameral Parliament and has been over-stressed through large scale retrofitting done over the years,"" the minister said.

He said that the other buildings such as Krishi Bhawan and Udyog Bhawan were built on the Central Vista after independence. ""These buildings are more than 50 years old and there is a shortage of working space, parking, amenities and services in these buildings for efficient office atmosphere."" ""The spread of central government ministries and departments in different locations leads to inefficiency and the problems can be resolved by developing a Common Central Secretariat,"" the minister said.

He also said that the Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of New Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi. It is used for the Republic Day Parade and various other functions which showcase the national capital to the world.

""However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking etc. The unorganised vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. Therefore, there is a need for the upgradation of the Central Vista,"" Puri added. The minister also said that the consultancy work for Central Vista redevelopment project has been awarded to HCP Design Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd. through a quality-cum-cost based (QCBS) tendering system followed by the Central Public Works Department.","Central Vista Redevelopment Project Could Become Fulcrum of Economic Revival, Says Puri",9,2020

The apex court made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

The top court was hearing a plea against the Delhi High Court order which said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project of the central government.

""Any change at the ground level will be at their own risk,"" said a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar.

The vehement plea of the petitioner that the ground situation at the site should not be changed as there are several monuments of national heritage which may be removed, did not cut much ice with the court which observed that the project will not be completed within a week.

The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, was informed by the petitioner that two notifications have been issued, one regarding land use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

""We have already said, whatever steps are taken, it is on their risk,"" the bench observed.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on July 7, allowed the petitioner to amend his plea to challenge the recent decisions taken by the authority for the project.

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, argued that till the next date of hearing no clearance should be granted as all those clearances will also be challenged.

The bench asked the petitioner to file his compilation by June 23 and directed the Centre to file its response by July 3.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

According to the committee's website, a special secretary or additional secretary of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is the chairman of the HCC.

It was set up by incorporating a new Clause 23 in Delhi Building Bylaws 1983 for the protection of heritage buildings, heritage precincts and natural feature areas in the national capital. The website states that committee has additional director general (CPWD), chief town planner (MCD), DDA commissioner (Plng), chief architect (NDMC), representative of DG (Archaeological Survey of India) and National Museum of National History's director among others as its members.

""The CPWD will approach the committee and seek permission before the start of construction work of new Parliament building. Other formalities will also be followed by concerned agencies,"" an official in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said. Another official said that the outlook of the new building will be similar to the existing one that is why there should be no problem in getting permission from the Heritage Conservation Committee In September last year, Tata Projects Limited had won the contract to build the new Parliament building.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to the ambitious project of the Modi government. In the majority verdict, the apex court said that prior permission shall be taken from Heritage Conservation Committee and other relevant authorities before the start of construction at new sites. The court directed that the project proponent set up smog tower and use anti-smog guns at the construction site Kanchi Kohli, senior researcher, Centre for Policy Research, claimed that the Supreme Court judgment is only about permissions for the new Parliament, selection of the project consultant and change of land use for the some components of the Central Vista Project.

""The Supreme Court has held no construction even on the new Parliament can take place till the Heritage Conservation committee grants permission, which mandates a public consultation according to the Unified Building Byelaws, 2016,"" Kohli told PTI. The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday welcomed the court's judgement and asserted that the government has always been sensitive to environmental concerns. ""Delhi is on course to becoming a World Class capital city and in the first step by the time nation completes 75 years of its Independence in 2022 a new Parliament building will be ready reflecting the aspirations of new India,"" Puri tweeted.

Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building where the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building. The new Parliament will have six committee rooms to conduct business.

The government has identified around four locations  in Gole Market, K G Marg, near Africa Avenue and near Talkatora Stadium  in central Delhi for the temporary shifting of offices of various ministries.

Tata Projects quoted the second-lowest bid amount of Rs 488.78 crore for the Central Vista Avenue/Rajpath redevelopment project being executed under the government's Rs 13,500 crore Central Vista revamp project.

An official said the historic Rajpath will go for redevelopment work soon after hosting the Republic Day parade on January 26. The work may be completed before the 2022 Republic Day parade. The Rajpath redevelopment project includes large scale stone work, construction of underpasses, underground amenities blocks and horticulture work, the official said.

In its notice inviting tender, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the Central Vista project, said that the redevelopment work of Central Vista Avenue will be executed in a phased manner so that some parts of Rajpath are available for visitors. The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new prime minister residence and PMO, and new Vice President Enclave.

When contacted, Shapoorji Pallonji Group did not comment. Apart from Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited and Tata Projects Limited, NCC Ltd and ITD Cementation India Limited had qualified for the opening of financial bids.

ITD Cementation India Limited quoted the bid amount of Rs 490.59 crore while NCC Ltd quoted Rs 601.46 crore as the bid amount. In September last year, Tata Project had won the tender work for the construction of the new Parliament building, The CPWD said that once the redevelopment of Rajpath is complete, a separate supplementary agreement for comprehensive maintenance and operation of services will be drawn for a period of five years with the contractor.

893,https://www.news18.com/news/india/sc-dismisses-plea-against-delhi-hc-order-rejecting-pil-to-halt-central-vista-work-3904727.html,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a PIL seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID pandemic.

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose said it is not inclined to interfere with the high court order as the PIL petitioners had selectively chosen Central Vista project and did not even do basic research about other public projects which were allowed during the lockdown in the national capital.

It said the high court findings on the PIL that it was 'motivated"" and filed with 'ill-intent"" and 'lack of bona fides"" is a possible view. The top court also refused to interfere with the Rs 1 lakh cost imposed on the petitioners.

The main Central Vista project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the prime minister and the vice president. It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries. During the hearing, the bench said, if this was your conduct, then Rs 1 lakh cost was less, adding that when an affidavit was filed before the high court that the project was fully compliant with COVID protocols, then why did you pursue the case.

Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for petitioners  Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary film maker  said that when the petition was filed they were non-compliant and later they have complied with the conditions. They were non-compliant from April 19 to April 30, he said.

The bench said that being public spirited persons had they done research on how many projects were given permission to continue the construction activity and how they selected this Central project. As a PIL petitioner, have you done any honest research as to how many other public projects were allowed and how did you pick up this project and say that it will be a super spreader of virus, the bench said.

Luthra said the petitioners were specific that they wanted order only with respect to stalling the construction activity which was not in compliance with the COVID protocol directions issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). On May 31, the Delhi High Court had described the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment, which entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan, as a 'vital and essential"" project of national importance. It had dismissed the PIL against it saying it was 'motivated"" and filed with 'ill-intent"" and 'lack of bona fides"" and imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners, while observing that it was 'not genuine public interest litigation"".

The high court had said it disagreed with the petitioners' claim that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, should be halted during the prevailing pandemic.

'The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. This work is part and parcel of the Central Vista project and of vital public importance. The construction of Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project cannot be seen in isolation, it said. 'In fact, the whole Central Vista project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project,"" it added.

The high court further said that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners and not a genuine public interest litigation and dismissed it with Rs 1 lakh to be deposited by the petitioners with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority within four weeks.

The apex court also for the first time got as many as nine judges in one go including Justice B V Nagarathna, who is poised to become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027.

The year witnessed change of guard at the top of judiciary with Justice N V Ramana, hailing from an agriculturist family of Ponnavaram village in Andhra Pradesh's Krishna district, taking charge as the 48th CJI upon retirement of his predecessor Justice S A Bobde in April.

The collegium led by the CJI made a slew of recommendations leading to filling up nine vacant posts in SC and over 100 posts in high courts. For the first time, three women judges  Hima Kohli, Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi  got the judgeship at the top court.

The Justice Ramana-led collegium ended the 21-month-long logjam over appointment of judges to the apex court when nobody was appointed after the superannuation of the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi on November 17, 2019.

With the country witnessing an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19, the apex court passed several directions to assuage the miseries of the citizens. But the judiciary lost legal luminary Soli Sorabjee due to coronavirus. Another sad news came as the top court lost sitting judge Mohan M Shantanagoudar in April. In a significant verdict, the apex court refused to refer to a larger bench to revisit its 29-year-old Mandal verdict, putting cap on quotas at 50 per cent, as it quashed a Maharashtra law granting reservations to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, saying it violated the principle of right to equality.

It also said that reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes in local bodies concerned in Maharashtra cannot exceed an aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and OBCs taken together. Later in the year, it directed the State Election Commission of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to notify the seats reserved for the OBCs in local bodies in these two states for the general category.

The Centre got mixed results in 2020 in the apex court which gave the green signal to the strategic Chardham highway project near China border after taking note of security concerns and also junked pleas to stall the ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi. The top court found ""no infirmity"" in grant of environment clearance and other permissions for the Central Vista and at the fag end, dismissed another plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where new residence of the Vice President is proposed.

It also upheld the Centre's power to extend Sanjay Kumar Mishra's tenure as Director of the Enforcement Directorate but clarified that extension of officers after the age of superannuation should be done rarely and in exceptional cases. However, it trashed opposition of the government to pleas for probe into alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance and appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to investigate under the monitoring of former apex court judge R V Raveendran, saying the state cannot get a ""free pass"" every time the spectre of national security is raised and it cannot be the ""bugbear"" that the judiciary shies away from.

It also intervened to ensure fair probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people including four farmers were killed during a protest as it appointed Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to monitor the investigation of Uttar Pradesh SIT which will also have three IPS officers. The apex court, which took back its 2020 order of extending period of limitation for filing cases due to the pandemic saying the country was returning to normalcy, again found itself in the midst of the brutal second wave and passed a slew of orders on issues ranging from delivery of oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, insurance for frontline workers, helping sex workers, migrant labourers, kids in street situation and those orphaned by COVID-19 and payment of ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of those who died of the infection.

Terming the resurgence of Covid cases as ""national crisis"", the CJI even advanced the Supreme Court's summer vacation and also ordered decongestion of prisons by ordering immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole in 2020. The top court said black marketing of critical COVID-19 drugs and oxygen is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery and directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute offenders.

Highlighting the digital divide between rural and urban India, it posed searching queries to the Centre on mandatory registration on CoWIN for Covid jabs, vaccine procurement policy and differential pricing, saying the policy makers must have ears on ground to effectively deal with the unprecedented crisis. At the fag end of the year, the court was dismayed over the poor air quality in Delhi-NCR and asked the Centre-appointed panel to work on finding a permanent solution to the menace.

The year also saw the Supreme Court staying till further orders the implementation of three farm laws and constituting a committee to listen to grievances of the protesting farmer unions', which held an over a year-long protest at Delhi borders, as also make recommendations to resolve the impasse. The three farm laws were subsequently repealed leading to a situation where a clutch of pleas challenging their validity and others against the blockade by farmers in the apex court became infructuous.

The much-anticipated corporate battle resulted in a victory for the Tata Group with the top court setting aside appellate tribunal NCLAT's order which had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the USD 100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. In a major victory for US-based e-commerce giant Amazon, the apex court held that Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator award, restraining the Rs 24,731 crore merger deal of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail, is valid and enforceable under Indian arbitration laws.

Nine years after taking up cudgels against Supertech, home buyers finally got relief from the top court as it ordered demolition of the under-construction twin 40-storey towers which would have blocked sunlight and fresh air, violating building norms in collusion with NOIDA officials. During the year, it also put the curtains down on suo motu proceedings initiated to probe a ""larger conspiracy"" behind sexual harassment allegations against former CJI Gogoi in April 2019.

It also closed the nine-year-old criminal proceedings that were initiated in India against two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012, after Rs 10 crore compensation was paid by Italy to heirs of the deceased and the boat owner. It also said that according to the international arbitral award accepted by India, Italy shall resume further probe in the case against the marines  Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.

In another significant verdict, the top court said the Delhi Assembly and its committee have the power to compel attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of privilege.

He also told officials to ensure Covid-19 vaccination and monthly health check-up of all workers engaged at the site, a Prime Minister's Office (PMO) statement said on Monday.

The prime minister had visited the site on Sunday evening and had laid emphasis on timely completion of the project. He interacted with workers engaged at the site and also enquired about their well-being.

Prime Minister Modi stressed that they are engaged in a 'pious and historic"" work. The digital archive at the site should also reflect their personal details, including their name, place they belong to, their picture, while noting their contribution to the construction work, he said.

Workers should also be given a certificate about their role and participation in this endeavour, the statement said. The surprise inspection by the prime minister was done with minimal security detail, and he spent over an hour at the site, it added.

Government officials have said that the new building will be ready by Parliament's winter session in 2022. The new parliament building will have an area of 64,500 square metres.

It will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members.

896,https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/what-to-do-about-concerned-retired-top-bureaucrats-writing-letters-on-central-vista-3842138.html,"No group of 'concerned' retired top bureaucrats (CRTBs) attributed the idea of a new parliament building first mooted by former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar (herself a former civil servant) in 2012 to tantriks, superstition or even to an egomaniacal desire of her supreme leader. It is clear that CRTB letter writers do not ascribe such irrational behaviour to one of their own. Nor do they think that their own actions can ever be characterised as such.

So Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri's stinging broadside this week must have come as a nasty surprise. After all, he is also one of thema retired civil servantbut, unlike them, he has not been put out to graze. And write letters, of course. The CRTBs also do not realise that ascribing superstition as a motive to this follow-through of Kumar's idea also sheds a less than kindly light on their own actions and those currently still in service.

At the time Kumar took the first steps towards a new buildingthat included a letter from her OSD to the Union urban development ministry citing the bad condition of the Herbert Baker-designed Parliament Houseno CRTBs voiced their angst. Maybe because many letter writers were still in service at the time. And, of course, there was no social media platforms for earlier CRTBs to air their concerns well before the postman could do his job.

Contrary to 'reports' that have now reached the CRTBs ears, no one actually has to resort to the extra-sensory perceptions of tantriks to realise the current Parliament building's situation is parlous. Those who as serving bureaucrats sat in the galleries flanking the MPs seats in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha rarely looked skywards for inspiration or succor. Otherwise, they could not have missed the patches of damp and cracks on the domed ceilings.

The efforts to bring a heritage building up to speed in the age of air conditioning and information has been decidedly unsympathetic to its delicate architecture. A peek into the less-exalted environs of the building show cruel holes in walls and ceilings to allow ingress of cables, pipes and ducts. As maintenance is predictably bad, the detritus of various repairing sprees remain on site as a breeding ground for not only damp but also dust, grime and vermin.

A metallic net has been affixed to the ceilings of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, probably to protect the fragile plasterwork and prevent any recalcitrant chunks from taking a kamikaze dive and landing on lawmakers' heads. There is also plenty of other evidence of ad hoc patch-up jobs. As stop-gap measures, these are fine; but how long could it go on without proper large-scale repairs that would need both chambers to be vacated for long spells of time?

In 2018, British MPs voted to move out of their historic Houses of Parliament in Westminster to allow major renovation workthat will cost many times more than making a new one, of course! It was felt that the repairs on the mid-19th century building should have begun at least 40 years earlier. A parliamentary committee listed fire, sewage inundation and electrical failure as imminent risks. One MP even said urine was leaking into his office.

Some stonework had not been cleaned since work began on the current Westminster building in the 1840s and sections are crumbling; parts of the roof also need repair. There is also justifiable concern about asbestoscommonly used before it was found to be carcinogenicstill lurking behind false ceilings and walls in the innards of the building. All these factors are equally applicable to the Parliament building at the foot of Raisina Hill.

It is estimated that the repair work on Westminstera Unesco World Heritage sitewill cost '�10 billion and begin in the mid-2020s with MPs relocated elsewhere for sessions for at least five to six years, which is an additional cost to be computed. The new Indian parliament building with all the latest mod-cons (and enough place for 400 more MPs after delimitation in 2026) will cost, as per stated current estimates, a shade under '�85 million.

For the bunch of CRTBs and other people very agitated about costs of buildings and repairs these daysvis-�-vis other spending imperativesthe benefits should be evident without the inputs of tantriks, clairvoyants or political leaders. And the issues highlighted about Westminster by those who occupy it (the MPs) are not only relevant to our own 1920s Parliament House but even government buildings that came up in later decades along Rajpath.

Most CRTBs have worked in sarkari buildings now earmarked for demolition at Rajpath at some point in their careers. They must be among the very few who were totally happy with their workspaces for them to be so concerned now that these buildings will make way for more ergonomically designed ones. Perhaps it is because being from the very highest echelons of the bureaucracy, they never really saw where and how the hoi polloi below worked.

The state of most of the officesbarring those for ministers, their immediate staff and the senior-most bureaucratsis cringeworthy. That joint secretaries and above have personal keys to access toilets out of bounds for their junior colleagues is a pungent reminder of the dire situation. Crumbling ceilings, windows obscured by coolers and ACs, almirahs of dusty files, paan-spittle stained corridors and stairs are the domain of the not-so-lofty.

If a straw poll is ever done among lower-level government employees past and presentdoomed to sit out their careers in ill-lit, badly ventilated, crowded and smelly environsabout the prospect of brand new offices with more space, light and amenities, their reaction would be markedly different from CRTBs. They would definitely say tantriks are not needed to convince them that better offices make for better productivity  and better health.

The cost of retrofitting the existing inadequate, dilapidated government office buildings to 21st century standards in terms of ventilation, workspace, energy conservation and communication would be astronomical. As much as the cost of new buildings. Indeed, in case of Westminster, it is estimated that repairing it with the MPs and staff in situor only moved out in batcheswould cost up to four times as much and take up to 32 years.

Not many people know that the Capitol Building in Washington DC that houses the US Senate and House of Representatives in two wings connected by a central colonnaded rotunda topped by a huge dome has been expanded in phases ever since it was first constructed in 1800. As the states and lawmakers increased, the building added wings (and two domes in succession), with the older chambers being made into museums. That sounds familiar

That Puri called out fellow former bureaucrats marks a watershed in this one-way discourse. No one writes an open letter back to CRTBs after all. And while they constitute a minority of the vast number of retired IAS, IFS, IPS and other 'class 1' officers, by default some 60, 120 (or whatever number is contacted to affix their signatures to particular letters) claim to speak for them all. Is there any reason for anyone to take them seriously?

Their concern about the Central Vista project is puzzling. Do they secretly crave to work in those decrepit buildings along Rajpath again? Do their children or their wider family or social circle want to do so? The government should temporarily billet them in the very offices CRTBs never entered as serving officersthe cubby holes that pass for offices of the lower bureaucracy. That may have a salutary effect on their perspective on this issue.

It may be germane to also find out how many of them frequent Rajpath's lawns along with the hundreds of middle-class families who regularly flock to its open spaces and lines of ice cream vendors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that CRTBs are more likely to be found sipping sundowners on Delhi Gymkhana Club's exclusive lawns as most of their careers have not exactly been spent directly engaging with the ordinary folks found on those lawns.

The CRTBs has voiced many other concerns about the project in their 'open letter' which are based on 'reports' and 'facts' that are about as reliable as their information that the new Parliament House was initiated due to 'superstitions' that it was unlucky rather than an understanding of the travails of an ailing heritage building. Each of those points deserves to be called out, with at least as much vigour as the minister's denouement. Watch this space!

An official from HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, which has prepared the master plan of the ambitious project, said that MP offices will come up where Shram Shakti Bhavan and Transport Bhavan are currently located on Rafi Marg and Sansad Marg respectively.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building where the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building. According to the plan, a tunnel would be constructed to connect the building with chambers of MPs in the Parliament complex.

'The new Parliament will have six committee rooms to conduct business,"" the HCP official said. The government has identified around four locations  in Gole Market, K G Marg, near Africa Avenue and near Talkatora Stadium  in central Delhi for the temporary shifting of offices of various ministries.

Government sources said that the demolition of buildings will be carried out in phases to ensure smooth functioning of various ministry offices. To construct Common Central Secretariat for ministry offices, several buildings like Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan among others are likely to be demolished.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. According to the CPWD's latest proposal for the redevelopment of Central Vista, the prime minister's new residential complex will have 10 four-storey buildings with a maximum height of 12 metres.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore. The prime minister's new residence will be built on a 15-acre plot and it will have 10 buildings and they will have ground plus three floors, the CPWD said in its proposal.

In the letter, also marked to Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, the former bureaucrats said there was no parliamentary debate or discussion that preceded the decisions taken with regard to the project.

Moreover, the redevelopment plans were not substantiated by any public consultation or expert review, it said.

The selection of the firm and the processes employed to do so leave a lot of questions unanswered, the letter added.

""In the post Covid 19 scenario, when enormous funds are required for strengthening the public health system, to provide sustenance to people and to rebuild the economy, taking up a proposal to redesign the entire Central Vista at a cost of at least Rs 20,000 crores, a figure likely to escalate significantly, seems particularly irresponsible.

""It seems like Nero fiddling while Rome burns,"" it said.

Signatories to the letter include retired IAS, IPS and IFS officers. Former DDA vice-chairman V S Ailawadi and former Prasar Bharti CEO Jawahar Sircar are also among them.

The Central Vista redevelopment project envisages constructing a new Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and revamping of the nearly 3.5-km-long stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate.

The letter said construction and redesign on the scale planned in the redevelopment project would significantly affect the heritage nature of this precinct and destroy it ""irrevocably"".

The former civil servants also pointed that the redevelopment planned will, moreover, cause severe environmental damage.

""This precinct is at the core of the congested capital of Delhi, and acts as the lungs of the city, with its dense mature tree canopies serving as a repository of bio diversity and the vast lawns of the Vista as a watershed for the city between the Ridge and the Yamuna,"" it said.

Constructing a large number of multi-storeyed office buildings, with basements, in this open area will create ""congestion and irreversibly change and damage the environment"".

""Delhi already suffers from enormous environmental pollution. To plan something which will increase this pollution many, many times, not merely during the construction phase but also subsequently, is clearly a thoughtless and irresponsible act,"" the letter further said.

The former bureaucrats also pointed out that the Central Vista serves at present as a recreational space for the whole city as families throng the area on summer nights to sit around in the open air and enjoy the occasional ice-cream ""innocent and inexpensive pleasures"" which they will be deprived of once the vista's character undergoes a change.","'Is This Needed Right Now?'

Suri and Srivastava, in their pleas before the single judge, have opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

They have contended that DDA does not have the power to bring about the proposed change in land use and master plan and only the central government can do so.

900,https://www.opindia.com/2020/12/central-vista-why-india-needs-new-parliament-building-and-secretariate/,"One of the major features of the Narendra Modi government has been the opposition the government has faced in almost each and every decision it has taken. Not just issues like Article 370 and triple talaq ban, the opposition parties and left-liberal ecosystem have also opposed important infrastructure projects like highway projects, bullet trains, railway network enhancement, seaport construction etc. One of such projects is the central vista project, including the construction of the new parliament building.

With PM Modi scheduled to conduct the Bhoomi Pujan for the new parliament building on 10th December, the usual suspects have started questioning the project. According to them, there is no need of a new parliament building, as the existing one is sufficient. While some of them are not questioning the need for the project, all of them are asking why now. According to them, including to the Congress party, when the economy is facing hardship and the country is facing a pandemic, the money earmarked for the central vista project should be diverted to social welfare.

Not just Left-liberals and opposition parties, many common people are also asking what is the need for a new parliament building when we already have one. They are asking this because they genuinely don't know the reason. The article is an attempt to answer those questions, which is mainly based on a presentation by Bimal Patel, the chief architect of the project.

The Central Vista project

The Central Vista project involves the redevelopment of the area known as Central Vista Avenue, the area between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate, where all the important buildings related to the union government are located. This project has two main parts, a new parliament building, and a new secretariat complex to bring all the central govt ministries in one place. A third part involves the development of the Rajghat and the area around it, which is available for the general public, including the development of public amenities. This project will involve demolition of some non-heritage buildings in the area, and construction of new buildings in place of them.

The Central Vista was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, to house the capital of British India. The top of the Raisina Hill and adjacent hills in the area was flattened to create space for the buildings. The original capital included the Viceroy's House (Rashtrapati Bhawan), the two secretariate buildings (North Block and South Block), The Council House (Parliament House). The National Archive building further down the Rajpath was also built by Lutyens, known as Imperial Record Department at that time. The Rajpath was known as King's way, and the Janpath was known as Queen's way.

The entire area on both sides of the Rajpath was an open area, covered by gardens at that time, it didn't have the various office buildings we see now. According to the original plan by Lutyens and Baker, several other buildings were to be built on that area, for both administrative and cultural purposes. But various reasons like budget constraints, the independence movement, war etc put a halt on the project in 1931, which was never resumed.

In 1947, the government of Independent India occupied the structures in the central vista for the capital. As the original British plan was incomplete, the Indian government later added several buildings for various ministries and departments. The central govt had allocated plots in the area to various ministries, and the ministries added their buildings as per their choice, with no similarity with the existing heritage buildings.

While the original capital built by the British was sufficient for that time, it was not built for a country with 130 crore people. After a century, needs have arisen to add new structures, as the existing ones are no longer sufficient for India's growing needs. To address these needs, the central vista development project has been envisioned. Now let's examine each of the component of the project and their need in detail.

Why a new parliament building is needed

The most significant aspect of the project is the construction of a new parliament building. There are several reasons for needing a new building to house the two houses of the parliament. The most important one is, the impending expansion of the size of the parliament. Due to increased population, which have almost quadrupled since independence, there is a need to increase the number of Lok Sabha constituencies through delimitation.

According to the original plan, although the number of Lok Sabha members to remain constant, the number of MPs in states were to be changed every 10 years to reflect the change in population. This change was to ensure that every MP will represent an equal number of citizens. But when the govt of India adopted a policy of population control in 1970s, it posed a problem. If the number of seats was to be re-allocated to states according to population, states that failed to control population growth would be rewarded with more seats, while states that successful in population control program would be punished with lesser seats. This had also led to a North-South conflict, as Southern states were more successful in controlling population compared to Northern states.

Due to this anomaly, the number of Lok Sabha constituencies was frozen in 1976 up to 2001. When this 25-year term was over, it was again pushed back by 25 years, and now the next delimitation exercise is scheduled for 2026, which is fast approaching. With a 50 year-long freeze on the number of MPs, it is expected that it is not going to be postponed one more time. The number of states and the Indian population has increased a lot since 1976, and there is an urgent need to increase the number of Lok Sabha members so that each MP represents a manageable size of the population. It is speculated that the size of the Lok Sabha will be increased to more than 800 from the current strength of 543.

But there is a big problem before the Lok Sabha strength can be increased, the size of the Lok Sabha hall in the Parliament House. There are only 552 seats in the current house, with no scope for adding any new seat. In fact, the wall on the back of Lok Sabha was already taken down, and the corridor next to it was included the Lok Sabha hall to create more space for additional chairs for the MPs. Therefore, the strength of the Lok Sabha can't be increased without creating space to accommodate all the MPs.

Similarly, the central hall of the parliament, used to hold joint sessions, actually does not have enough seats for the MPs of both houses. The Central hall has around 430 seats, less than the size of Lok Sabha. During joint sessions, temporary chairs are placed on the aisles so that all the members can sit. Certainly not a dignified scene for the parliament of the largest democracy of the world.

The Central hall also serves as the lounge of the parliament, as the building does not have any dedicated lounge for the members to spend their time outside session hours. It is notable that a lounge is not just a place for passing free time, it is also a place where informal discussions take place, networks are built etc. It is a very important place for discussing bills in an informal setting.

The sitting arrangement in all the houses in parliament are of bench type, with longer benches as one moves towards the back of the house. This means, when members enter or exit their place, they have to pass over other members sitting in the same bench. The members also don't have any desk in front of them, except for the first two rows. From the third row onwards, microphones and voting panels are actually fitted on the backrests of the benches in front of the respecting benches. This is a very clumsy arrangement and does not offer any place for the members to keep their documents and other personal belongings.

Several newly built assembly houses in the country have sitting arrangements with two members per seat, with proper desks and tables. Even many schools and colleges in the country have abandoned benches and introduced single and twin sitting arrangements, but our Parliamentarians still seat on long benches with no desk at all.

Crumbling infrastructure inside Parliament House

The infrastructure of the parliament also antiqued, as they were added at various times as and when required. It has microphones that can't be switched off, a very old electronic voting system etc. Although the parliament building looks magnificent from the outside, the same is not true about its inside. Due to drilling holes in the walls to run electrical and telecommunication lines, water and sewage pipes, air-conditioning ducts etc, it all looks a mess from inside. Such drillings have also weakened the structure a lot.

Along with that, the area around Delhi has become more earthquake-prone in recent times. But as the original drawings of the building are not available now, it not possible to certify the building as earthquake-proof now. It is notable here that two floors have been added on the top of the parliament building to make space for offices, and it has almost blocked the visibility of the central dome.

Two floors were added to the top of the Parliament House later, blocking the view of the central dome

Due to these reasons, a pressing need was felt to construct a new parliament building. Once the new building is constructed, the old one will be retrofitted and retained as a heritage building. Some functions of the parliament will remain in this building after adequate improvements are made. This includes the library, the parliamentary committee rooms etc.

How the new parliament building will look like

For the new parliament building, a triangular plot next to the current building has been chosen, located to the east of it. The plot currently does not have any significant structure, apart from parking facilities, police barrack etc. As the plot is triangular, the shape of the new parliament house has been chosen as triangular for maximum use of available space.

Old and new Parliament Houses

The new parliament house will have a Lok Sabha hall, a Rajya Sabha hall, a Lounge around a courtyard, and a central space called the Constitution gallery. It will not have a separate central hall, as the Lok Sabha will have enough sitting capacity hold joint sessions. In the triangular building, the Lok Sabha will be at the north-west corner, Rajya Sabha will be at the south-west corner, and the lounge will be at the eastern corner. There will be offices on the outer edges of the building, surrounding the houses and the lounge.

Although the overall size of the new parliament building is almost similar to the old one, it will have much more floor space. This is because, the circular Parliament House has three large courtyards inside it, while the new one will have just a small courtyard, and most of it will be utilised for functional purposes.

Fort example, the new Lok Sabha hall will be 1315 square meter in size, compared to 470 square meter if the current one. It will also have a much larger lobby, which is almost non-existent at present. However, the office spaces for Lok Sabha will be retained same, as it has been considered sufficient. The comparative sizes of the current and proposed Lok Sabha can be viewed in the drawings below.

Size comparison of old and new Lok Sabha (source: HCP Design)

The Lok Sabha will have a capacity of 876 seats. But the seats are much larger in size, and they can actually hold 1350 persons. Therefore, it will easily accommodate joint sessions of the parliament, not requiring a separate hall for joint sessions. The Lok Sabha will also have more space for visitors on the gallery on the first floor.

The interior of the Lok Sabha will be themed on India's national bird peacock, and its traditional green colour will be retained.

Similar to Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha will also be much larger in the new Parliament House. It will have 400 seats, to accommodate more members which will be necessitated due to creation of several new states over the last several years. The drawing below shows that the Rajya Sabha will be almost four times the size of the existing one, with much larger main hall and lobby areas, while office space will be slightly reduced.

Size comparison of old and new Rajya Sabha (source: HCP Design)

The interior of the Rajya Sabha will be themed on India's national flower lotus, and its traditional red colour will be retained.

For seating arrangement in both houses, there will be individual benches for two members, with proper desk in front of them. But the seats are large enough for three persons, which will enable holding of joint sessions in the Lok Sabha hall.

The technology will also much improved, with modern touch interfaces on the desks to help run a paperless digital parliament. The interiors will be built while considering acoustic aspects, so that viewers viewing live proceedings will have much better sound experience.

On the eastern corner of the triangle, the lounge will be located on the ground floor, and dining facilities will be located on the first floor. There will be an open courtyard at the centre of the lounge.

A small library will be located next to the lounge, towards the inside of the building. It will be a place for people to sit and work on their notes etc. The main library of the parliament will remain in its current place.

The central space of the building, a triangular shape, with arms leading to entrances, will be called the Constitution Hall. The three entrances that lead to this central hall will be public galleries, where some important materials related to the parliament and the republic will be located.

Constitution Hall (source: HCP Design)

The Constitution Hall below the central dome will have sculptures and portraits of parliamentarians, and other images representing various aspects of India. To the east of Constitution hall, a space will be created called the Constitution Gallery. The original constitution of India will be displayed here.

On the plot north to the parliament, chambers for the parliamentarians will be built. It currently has some ministry offices, which will be moved to the central secretariate to be built under the central vista project.

The need for Central Secretariate

The second part of the central vista project is the central secretariate, to house the offices of all ministries in one location. At present, the North Block and South Block houses some ministries, while several other buildings added later in the area hosts several other ministries. But despite that, a large number of ministry offices are located outside the central vista area, scattered across the city of Delhi.

Out of the 51 ministries of the union govt, which have around 51,000 employees, 22 ministries are located inside central vista, with around 41,000 employees. The remaining ministries and their around 10,000 employees are located outside this area. This causes lots of movement in the city contributing to traffic, and also causes waste of time in inter-ministerial works.

A large number of offices outside Central Vista are located in rented places. According to govt sources, an amount of around Rs 1000 crore is paid every year for the rents of ministry offices in private buildings. This cost is one of the major reasons of the Central Secretariate project.

The Central Vista area also houses several establishments that are not needed in the area. There are army barracks and defence offices where around 9000 defence personnel work.

How the Central Secretariate will look like

The Central Secretariate project aims to place all the offices of the union govt in the Central Vista area. For this, the secretariate offices of various ministries of the government will be housed in new secretariate buildings in the area, while the defence establishments will be moved out. This will result in net addition of only 1000 people, as while 10000 people will come in, 9000 will go out.

The Central Secretariate will include 10 identical buildings. A conference hall and the national archive will also located in the area.

Proposed Central Secretariat (OpIndia Image)

The secretariate buildings will be rectangular Doughnut shaped buildings, with a large courtyard in the middle. Trees will be planted in the courtyard. They will be built on four plots on the both sides of Rajpath, which are currently fenced plots where various buildings are already located. This means, no extra open space will be used to build the secretariate, it will use the existing used space.

The outside of the buildings will be stone-clad, to match with the existing Lutyens buildings, but the inside facing the courtyard will be covered with glass and steel. The height of the multi-storied buildings will be similar to existing buildings, and they will not be taller than the India Gate, which is 42 meters high.

In three of the four plots, three buildings each will be constructed. But the fourth one, the North-East plot, will have only one secretariate building. In the rest of the place in the plot, a Central Conference Centre will be built. At present, there is no proper conferencing facility at the Central Vista, although the Vigyan Bhawan has some limited facilities. The Conference Centre will have all the modern conferencing facilities.

The existing National Archive building, an old heritage structure, is also part of this plot, which will be retained. A new structure will be added to the National Archive to cater to the growing need.

The central secretariate will be a mass transit-oriented project, as an underground transit system will be constructed which will connect all the buildings with the nearby metro networks. It will be a rectangular underground transit path around the Central Secretariate, using which a shuttle service will move people in and out of the secretariate buildings, eliminating the need of cars for a large number of people.

Facilities for vice President and Prime Minister

At present, the Vice-President's house is located inside the Central Vista, near the India Gate circle, and it falls within the proposed site for Central Secretariate complex. While the Prime Minister's residence is outside the Central Vista area. Under the project, both these residences will be moved next to the Rashtrapati Bhawan.

The Vice President's resident will be built in front of the Rashtrapati Bhawan on the northern side, to the north of the North Block. This plot currently has hutments housing army barracks and offices, which will be moved out.

The Prime Minister's resident will be located directly opposite to the Vice President's house, in front of Rashtrapati Bhawan and to the south of South Block. This site also houses hutments which will be moved out. Both will be similar buildings, maintaining the symmetry of the area. Facilities for SPG will be built next to the PM's house.

To the east of PM's house, in the diamond-shaped area, the Prime Minister's Office will be built, along with a garden. This plot is directly opposite to the diamond-shaped plot with the new and old Parliament houses on the other side of Rajpath. This plot also presently has army offices, training colleges etc which are not needed in Central Vista. At present, the PMO is located inside the South Block.

Here is the complete layout of the Central Vista project.

Relocation of non-secretariate establishments

In order to build the new secretariate buildings, the existing buildings will have to be demolished. These include Shashtri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President's House, National Museum, and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The first four buildings house secretariate offices of various ministries and they will be moved to the new Secretariat complex. It may be noted that some of these buildings are already in bad shape. However, the Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan housing the ministry of external affairs is new, which was completed in 2011.

The role of Vigyan Bhawan will be fulfilled by the new conference centre. As already mentioned, a new residence for Vice President will come up near North Block. For the IGNCA, a new building will be built in front of the Hyderabad house on the other side of Rajpath. It will be built to look similar to Hyderabad house, but will have an extended section. The present IGNCA has a small structure as the project was not completed.

The most significant movement will be of the National Museum, currently located between Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan and Vigyan Bhawan on the southern side of Rajpath. The National Museum will be moved to the Heritage buildings of the North Block and South Block. As these two buildings will become empty after the ministry offices move to the new secretariat complex, the National Museum will be relocated to the twin buildings. Thus, these two original buildings built by Lutyens will be available to the general public for unhindered access.

In the plans for the Central Vista project, no new structures are proposed at present at the locations where the Rail Bhawan and Vayu Sena Bhawan are located. Both are identical triangular-shaped buildings directly opposite to each other across the Rajpath, located on triangular plots. Therefore, these two buildings may be retained. On the other side of the Central Vista, on similar triangular plots next to India Gate hexagon, similar triangular buildings are proposed, although their purposes have not been specified.

Development of public areas

Apart from building new structures, the Central Vista project also includes development of the area on the both side of the Rajpath from India Gate to North and South Block buildings, which is available for public. The lawns and gardens will be improved, public amenity facilities will be added, pathways will be rebuilt. New trees will also be planted, as many trees in the area has died, and others are so old that they will die in coming years. For this, a tree species survey is being done to ensure selection of proper species of trees for planting. Specific locations will be identified to located street-side vendors who cater to visitors and tourists.

Contrary to allegations of change of land use, that public space is being used for constructing buildings, actually available public space will increase due to rationalisation of land use. At present several govt buildings have encroached upon public places, which will be freed up after the project is completed.

At present, the lawns on both sides of Rajpath are damaged every year due to the Republic Day parade, as brick and mortar stands are built on them every year, and dismantled after the event. Temporary bridges are also placed on the canals on the both sides of the Rajpath, which also damage the canals. Under the project, permanent bridges will be constructed on the canals. For the Republic Day, mobile stands will be constructed which can be easily installed and dismantled without damaging the ground.

There is also a proposal to carve out an area of approximately 50 acres from the Western end of the Presidential Estate, which will be accessible from the road that runs on the western edge of the Presidential Estate. On the other end, the Central Vista is proposed to be extended to the banks of Yamuna River, where the New India Gardens or the Nav Bharat Udyan will be built to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India's independence.

Companies involved in the project

The master plan of the Central Vista project has been prepared by HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd, which had won the bid. The company is headed by renowned architect Bimal Patel, who has designed several public places, including the Sabarmati Riverfront at Ahmedabad, Central Vista project at Gandhinagar and the Mumbai Port Complex. Six companies had submitted bids, from which Patel's company was selected.

Tata Projects has won the bid for constructing the new parliament building, quoting the lowest cost of Rs 861.9 crore. Seven companies had placed technical bids for the project, from which three were selected for financial bids, Tata Projects, L&T and Shapoorji Pallonji. Only the first two had submitted financial bids after it. The government has set a deadline of March 2022 for the project, in time for the celebration of 75 years of India's independence.

Amidst the ongoing political tug-of-war surrounding the project, a 2018 tweet by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has gone viral online.

In the tweet dating May 22, 2018, Shashi Tharoor shared pictures of his visit to the new Malaysian Parliament and had sought for upgrading the Indian Parliament. 'Visited the Malaysian Parliament & entered the empty chamber of the Lower House. Felt a pang of envy: Each MP has their own nameplate, plush leather swivel chair, laptop &mike. We in the LokSabha sit crammed on benches with no leg room to stand, let alone swivel. Time for an upgrade!' he had tweeted 3 years ago.

Although the Congress Parliamentarian from Kerala had lamented in 2018 about the lack of adequate space in the current Parliament, he and his party members were seen rubbishing the idea of the Central Vista Project. On May 9 this year, Shashi Tharoor had shared an article written by Kapil Komireddi titled, 'Modi's ghastly Delhi dream.' The Congress MP said, 'A coruscating read: Kapil's erudite and well-researched takedown of the govt's grand central vista scheme.'

Screengrab of the 2021 tweet by Shashi Tharoor

Several netizens called out the Congress leader for his doublespeak and changing his stance out of political opportunism. A fired-up Tharoor took to Twitter to try and undo the damage caused due to his U-turn. He claimed, 'I see lots of Central Vista apologists making hay out of my 2018 tweet.' His tweet further read, 'The Parliament upgrade I sought could have been achieved by converting the Central Hall of the present Parliament into the Lok Sabha with all the facilities I admired in the Malaysian one. No new building needed.'

Screengrab of the tweet by Shashi Tharoor

Why the Central Hall of the current Parliament cannot be upgraded as proposed by Shashi Tharoor?

In 'defence' of his earlier tweet, the Congress Parliamentarian had claimed that the Central Hall of the existing Parliament could have been upgraded to accommodate the facilities of a new and modern parliament, like the Malaysian one he was so envious about. However, nothing can be further from the truth. It must be mentioned that the present Central Hall of the Indian Parliament is about 678 square metres while the Lower House (Lok Sabha) Hall in the new building will be 1340 square metres.

Moreover, the Central Hall of the Parliament is used to hold joint sessions of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. While Lok Sabha has 552 seats, the current Rajya Sabha has about 245 seats. In total, the total strength of Parliamentarians stands at 797. However, the Central Hall has a sitting capacity of just 430 seats, which is lower than the sitting capacity of even the Lok Sabha. Given that the Central Hall is just 679 square metres, it is not possible to extend its sitting capacity further or equip it with facilities that Shashi Tharoor had sought.

To add salt to the wound, the major problem arises while conducting joint sessions of the Parliament. With a sitting capacity of just 430 seats, not all 800 members can participate in a joint session discussion. As such, temporary chairs and benches are arranged so as to ensure that the other members could sit. For one of the fastest-growing economies of the world, this is rather an undignified sight. While Shashi Tharoor tried to come up with a credible defence of his 2018 tweet to appease his masters in Congress, his justification is rather juvenile and flawed.",Shashi Tharoor praises swanky new Malaysian Parliament but opposes Central Vista,6,2021

And it appears that he would like to be taken seriously. This time, he has a problem with the fact that the Central Government has frozen Dearness Allowances (DA) for employees until late next year.

I sincerely believe it is not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and also on the armed forces people: Former PM Dr Manmohan Singh on Centre freezing Dearness Allowance & Dearness Relief hike till July 2021 (Source  AICC) pic.twitter.com/JK2MmF5Nj4  ANI (@ANI) April 25, 2020

So how much is the usual hike in Dearness Allowance? About 4% of Basic Pay. Meanwhile, here is the Government of Maharashtra, in which the Congress has managed to become a ruling partner, despite finishing fourth in the elections.

Maharashtra government to pay 40% of March salary

Anywhere between 25-50% of salary frozen and deferred for state government employees. According to calculations by several expert economists, 4% is a lot less than 50%. Also bear in mind that dearness allowance is merely a compensation for inflation. With the economy at a standstill, right now the risk is one of deflation and not inflation. So, with the dearness allowance frozen and no inflation, the purchasing power of a Central Government employee would remain the same.

This is hardly the case with Maharashtra state government employees, who could see 50% of their salary deferred. You can easily imagine how this would wreak havoc on household budgets.

Why does it appear as if nobody listens to Dr. Manmohan Singh?

Anyway, among the demands made by the Congress, a call to scrap the Bullet Train project and the Central Vista redevelopment project in Delhi.

Congress on bullet train and Central Vista redevelopment plans

Why does it feel like scrapping the Bullet Train and Central Vista have become a Congress Party obsession? They seem to be a couple of weeks away from saying that one of Rajiv Gandhi's dreams was that India would never have a Bullet Train?

Now, if Dr. Singh took himself seriously as an economist, he would know that in times of recession, it is for the government to spend money on large public projects.

Indeed, when the Great Depression hit the United States in 1929, the government put people to work as part of a massive public works program. This came to be known as the 'New Deal.' Under the formidable Franklin D Roosevelt, the US government created the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933. The PWA completed some of the most iconic infrastructure projects in the US, including the legendary Hoover Dam. The infrastructure that the US created in that decade laid the foundation of the post WW2 boom when the US began a 70 year reign as the world's pre-eminent economic, military and industrial power.

In fact, the economic crisis triggered by the Wuhan Coronavirus could be the moment for India to launch its own 'New Deal.' This is the time to build those bullet trains, dams and super highways that could last us for several generations.

And considering that the bullet train is financed with a near interest free loan from Japan, it's a no brainer.

Along with the PWA, President Roosevelt also created the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as part of his New Deal. The role of the WPA was to fund the construction of public buildings, museums, theaters, libraries all across the United States. If Dr. Manmohan Singh had been around, he would probably have called them vanity projects.

It is not difficult to imagine why the Congress is so obsessed with scrapping the Bullet Train and Central Vista. They are probably worried that India might end up with landmarks on which they won't be able to stick the names of their one great dynasty. With no workers, no organization skills and no ideology, the Congress is just a brand name. Without everything being called 'Jawahar this' or 'Indira that' or 'Rajiv Gandhi XYZ,' the Congress would have to shut down.

It's bad enough that the Congress is being taunted for spending its decades in power allocating Bharat Ratnas rather than building toilets. What if tomorrow India has a bullet train and nobody gives credit to Rajiv Gandhi for dreaming it up? What would the Congress do then?

Hence the Congress obsession with stopping the project at all cost.

Incidentally, I have some advice for Dr. Manmohan Singh. More like a request.

Respected Sir, in the final days of the UPA government, your government gave you a parting gift that you would never have to pay for water and power again. In view of the economic crisis due to Wuhan Coronavirus, how about giving up that subsidy? Why not pay your own power and water bill? I am sure the nation would appreciate the gesture. Thanks.",Why is Congress obsessed with stopping Bullet Train and Central Vista?,4,2020

After a few delays over the last eight months, the avenue is finally ready to be open to the public. Wonderful images from the Avenue are now in the public domain, drawing already enthusiastic visitors.

Stunning visuals from the site have inundated social media drawing widespread attention and excitement. Images were shared by several social media users highlighting the enhancement in the beauty of the area which was primarily developed by the British coloniser.

According to The Indian Express, citing Ministry of Urban Development sources, the stretch is finished and should be dedicated soon. 'The minister is not in the country so far and the inauguration date will be finalised once he is back on Monday,' the source said.

The garden around India Gate.

The Central Vista project involves the reconstruction of Central Vista Avenue, which runs between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate and houses all of the union government's significant buildings. This project is divided into two parts: a new parliament building and a new secretariat complex that will house all of the key government departments in one location.

A third component entails the development of the Rajpath and the surrounding region, which is usually accessible to the general public, as well as the creation of public utilities. This project entails the demolition of several non-historical buildings in the neighbourhood and the construction of new structures in their stead.

The garden around India Gate.

The pathways, lawns, kiosks, and parking lot have been ready for many weeks, according to insiders, but the four underpasses, which will aid in seamless accessibility, were completed just a few days ago.

At the newly restructured avenue, pathways have been renovated, public amenity facilities have been constructed, and the nearby lawns and gardens have been restored. A number of new trees have been planted because many of the older trees in the area have perished or will soon. To guarantee that the right species of trees were chosen for planting, a survey of tree species was also conducted for this. The sites of street vendors that serve tourists and visitors have been pinpointed.

The open grass acreage will grow from 3,50,000 square metres to around 3,90,000 square metres in accordance with the proposal, and walkways over the canal will also be constructed. With space set aside for about 1,000 cars, efforts have also been taken to expand parking space, which remained a problem at India Gate.

905,https://www.opindia.com/2020/04/ram-guha-the-wire-fake-news-central-vista-hindustan-time-rejects-here-are-facts/,"Recently, Ramachandra Guha made a hue and cry about Hindustan Times rejecting to publish his article. As usual, he called it censorship and claimed that he will now never write for Hindustan Times. This article, which was essentially fake news, was published by the controversial publication, The Wire.

This latest rant is against the project to redesign 'New Delhi's Central Vista'. He begins his article by referring to another article as the basis for his argument! Don't you love the ecosystem that simply refers to each other's articles as some sort of concrete proof for their lies? In Guha's own assessment, 'Kishore (author) focused on one key element in the project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on Rajpath'

The author, Alpana Kishore, tells us that it already cost us about INR 10,000 crores, over the past 30 years, to construct the current PM's residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg (earlier 7RCR)! Where does she get her estimate from? She doesn't tell us. She only tells us that this is a 'conservative estimate'. Who gave this estimate? She doesn't tell us. And by this logic, she derives that the alleged proposed new house will cost INR 10,000 crores! ('Rs 10,000 crore on a second house for the prime minister'.) Not only does Guha freely feed on this lie, he goes on to spread the second lie that this redevelopment project will cost '20,000 crores and counting'.

He asks us this question  'Why can't the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista scheme  estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting be diverted to help ameliorate their (the poor suffering from the lockdown) condition?' There is not a single reference to the source of any of these numbers.

In this earlier article, we have traced the origin of this lie and its subsequent spread, so will not be elaborating on the same again. Here is a challenge to Guha  can he point out to one official document that tells us that 20,000 crores worth of funds has been 'currently allocated'? For an intellectual like Guha, it should be an easy challenge given that he claims that funds are already 'allocated'.

Do his concerns end with just the money? No. He again refers to the article by Alpana Kishore and tells us that the process of awarding the contract was 'a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge'. Oh boy, we now have the makings of a thriller movie here. Secrecy and subterfuge huh? Let's dig into the secrecy and subterfuge around this.

On September 2, 2019 the Union government issued a public press release, inviting bids for appointment of a consultant for 'Development/Redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista at New Delhi'. A press release announcing invitation for bids  that's how secret the process has been! The press release details the various eligibility criteria, financial and technical, needed to present a bid. The 'secret' press release also tells us why this redesign is necessary for the following:

Parliament of India (Building is >90 years old)

'Its facilities and infrastructure are inadequate to meet the current demand. There is an acute shortage of office space and there are no chambers for Members of Parliament. With the likely increase in the number of seats in Lok Sabha due to reorganization, the situation will further aggravate.'

Has the entire English media that is up in arms against the project given a single meaningful solution to this pressing problem? Isn't it really weird that each MP of our Parliament doesn't even have an office of their own? How do we expect them to work freely with the barrage of visitors and also with the heavy volume of committee related works? There are actually many secret documents that the MPs will have to refer and read  isn't having an office space a bare minimum requirement? Plus, how do we plan to accommodate the increased strength of the Lok Sabha? Instead of coming up with exorbitant numbers, why can't these 'intellectuals' come up with any meaningful solution?

Central Vista

'The Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of New Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi.. It lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking. The unorganized vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. Therefore, there is a need for its up gradation'

Isn't this true? If you visited this area, you would instantly realise it is actually true. And if this problem is being solved, why would someone have a problem with it? If we want to improve an area that has high tourist arrivals, wouldn't that automatically lead to more employment, more revenue and more importantly, better name for India? Do you know the number of solutions these 'intellectuals' have offered for this problem? Zero. A big fat Zero.

Common Central Secretariat

'Central Secretariat, at present, is spread over 47 buildings in Delhi, housing various Ministries, Departments, Attached and Subordinate Offices etc'

These buildings include the Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South Blocks etc. The document also tells us that since the North and South Blocks are >100 years old, they are not earthquake resistant enough. The press release document makes zero reference to the Prime Ministers' residence.

The bid document clearly states the following deadlines:

Parliament House to be constructed by July 2022 Central secretariat by March 2024 Central vista redesign by November 2020 (some news reports now say that the deadline in 2021)

If, for a moment, we were to believe that Narendra Modi 'yearns for a house on Rajpath', why would he set a March 2024 deadline for the same, when his present term ends in May 2024? Since Guha is so sure that Modi will win 2024 and continue to be PM till 2029, why would PM build such an opulence for himself for a mere 5 years of his final term? Assuming that the PM's residence will move to the new area  the occupants of the building will be the PM and his/her family  not Narendra Modi forever! How does such simple logic elude these 'intellectuals'?

A total of 24 firms attended the pre-bid meeting. A total of 6 firms finally bid for consultancy services for this project. A six-member jury selected Gujarat based HCP Design Ltd for this project. The government will be paying them INR 229 crores to this company for submitting plans of the redesign. All this was announced in a press conference by the Union Minister for Urban Affairs, Mr Hardeep Singh Puri. Yet another 'secret'! In the same press meet, he also told that consultancy costs are typically 3% of the total project costs. That will peg the overall cost of this project at ~INR7600 crores. This is nearly 1/3rdof the 20,000 crores lie that the English media is freely perpetrating.

So all this begs the question  where is the 'secrecy and subterfuge' in all of this? The exact process that has been followed for any tender and bid, has been followed here. The value of bids of competing firms will obviously not be disclosed. These tenders are only for the designs, which means the designs have not been finalized yet. Do you want to know where the problem of 'secrecy and subterfuge' is? Believe it or not, in their own words  'From announcement to selection, the process took barely 45 days'. It baffles me as to how our journalists have not yet realised that the Modi government works at a speed that is faster than any previous government. For them to assume that projects will take their own sweet time while they dish out inane articles and opinions about the same, is very amusing!

Do their concerns end here? Not yet. The mere mention of Gujarat set alarm bells ringing for Guha and company. Guha tells us that this company designed a new complex in IIM-Ahmedabad that is 'cold and soulless' and 'those assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original'. I think we must propose to the Government of India that they abandon the tender and bid process and just talk to Guha & company to chose architects of their choice!

Do their concerns still end? Phew, not yet! He asks why should the country's 75th year of Independence be celebrated in this manner? He tells us that 'Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently, what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn't quite do for Narendra Modi'.

That argument is the entire crux of Guha's insecurity with the Modi era. Modi is not an I.K.Gujral who will listen to this cabal and do as they say. Modi is not an Indira Gandhi who has imposed emergency in our country and trampled the freedom of every citizen of India, leave alone the press. Modi chooses to ignore the continuous rants and bile emanating from this cabal. Modi chooses to listen to the citizens of India and do what's best for them. Hence Guha's exasperation  how dare he does something that Indira Gandhi and I.K.Gujral didn't do!

The building of infrastructure is one of the many ways of reviving the economy and creating powerful symbols that will last centuries. Redesigning of these buildings will help with creating employment and further improve the functioning of the government of India. It is this improvement that Guha and company do not want. It is the creation of these symbols that Guha and company do not want. And to achieve this aim, they are following the only path they know  spread lies and stop progress of our country.","The Wire, Ram Guha peddle fake news about Central Vista project: Facts",4,2020
906,https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/the-print-claims-central-vista-toolkit-is-fake-after-congress-said-it-is-real/,"A day after propaganda website Alt News come up with a multitude of ludicrous claims to 'fact-check' and give a clean chit to the Congress party in the latest Covid-19 'toolkit' fiasco, another left-wing website 'The Print' has now descended to defend the grand old party.

Two toolkit documents, allegedly linked to the Congress party, had got leaked on social media recently, which entailed a detailed plan of action for the Congress leaders and supporters to exploit the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in the country and the Central Vista project to target the Modi government.

While the Congress party has claimed that the Covid-19 toolkit is fake, it has admitted the Central Vista document is real and the AICC Research Department had prepared it. Congress MP and AICC Research Department Chairman Rajeev Gowda, and Alt News, both had claimed that the Covid-19 toolkit document was used using the format of the real Central Vista document. Despite the clarification from the Congress party that the Central Vista document is authentic, The Print has come up with the claim that the document is fake.

On Thursday, the news website The Print, owned by Shekhar Gupta, published a bizarre 'investigative' report to give a clean chit to the Congress party in the ongoing 'toolkit' controversy. In its latest report, the Print has claimed that the even Central Vista document made by the Congress party is fake.

Further, the Print claimed that they had consulted a few 'cyber experts' to analyze the screenshots put out by the BJP leader, who declared that the screenshots were fake.

Here is Sambit Patra's tweet exposing the Congress party's link to the toolkit:

Friends yesterday Congress wanted to know who's the Author of the toolkit.

Pls check the properties of the Paper.

Author: Saumya Varma

Who's Saumya Varma 

The Evidences speak for themselves:

Will Sonia Gandhi & Rahul Gandhi reply? pic.twitter.com/hMtwcuRVLW  Sambit Patra (@sambitswaraj) May 19, 2021

According to the two cyber experts who were consulted by the Print, the first screenshot shared by Patra was fake. 'The file properties of the alleged toolkit as seen in the screenshot are inauthentic, with some technical elements missing in the description,' read the report.

The screenshot mentioned the filename as Central_Vista_Vanity_Project_AICC_Research__1_.pdf, which clearly indicates that they are claiming that the Central Vista document is fake, not the Covid-19 document that the Congress party claims to be fake.

Screenshot of the file information that Congress says is genuine but Print claims to be fake

As the filename clearly mentions the words 'Central Vista Vanity Project', it is clear that it shows information of the file admitted as genuine by the Congress party. OpIndia also has accessed the PDF file with the same filename, which contains the same content. The title of the document is 'Central Vista Redevelopment: Vanity Project Amidst the Pandemic', and it has been claimed even by Alt News that it is a genuine document, based on the original document received from the Congress party.

Sambit Patra had tweeted the Central Vista document on 18th May, and its content match with the content published by Alt News which they had received from the Congress party.

Toolkits are not alien to the Congress and their eco-system. Infact, a substantial part of their energy goes into making them.

Ironically, the Print's report claiming that the screenshots shared by Sambit Patra about the Central Vista toolkit is fake comes at a time when the Congress party itself has admitted that it is a genuine one. Congress leader Rajeev Gowda had taken to Twitter to admit that the Sambit Patra was showing the metadata of a real document created by one of his staff members. However, he added that Patra showed a fake document of the 'toolkit,' claiming to be created by the All India Congress Committee (AICC) Research Department.

Moreover, The Print seems to be confused about Congress claims about the toolkits. To be clear, there are two documents circulating on Social Media, one is on Central Vista and the other is on Covid-19. Congress party claims the Covid-19 document is fake and forged, and admits that the Central Vista document was indeed prepared by the AICC Research Department. While propaganda site Alt News stuck to this claim and tried to prove that the Covid-19 toolkit is fake as it uses a different font, The Print seems to have got confused. It ended up trying to prove that the Central Vista document is fake, while not even mentioning the other toolkit that is creating more controversy and which is fake according to Congress.

Strangely, The Print came up with some bizarre analysis over URL of files downloaded from WhatsApp to claim it is fake, forgetting that nobody is questioning the authenticity of the Central Vistal document.

Congress toolkit

On Tuesday, two documents were 'leaked' on social media which gave point to point notes on how to question and discredit the Modi government on a few key points. The documents were allegedly created by the AICC research development. While Congress had refuted one of the documents as fake, there were some uncanny similarities between the instructions in the toolkit and how the narrative especially around the pandemic was built.

The instructions issued in the Congress toolkit are all-encompassing and extensive to launch a formidable attack against the Modi government when they are engrossed in defeating the raging pandemic. From maligning the Kumbh Mela as a 'super spreader' event to unwarranted attacks against PM Modi for the Central Vista project to collaborating with 'friendly' journalists and international media to defame the Modi government, the toolkit prepared by AICC Research Department had detailed instructions to the Congress leaders and supporters to milk the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and mount an anti-Modi propaganda blitz.

The toolkit expose had created a storm across the country, fuelling massive anger against the Congress party. Several people accused the grand old party of indulging in such cheap politics, especially during a national crisis, to further their political agenda against the Modi government. As accusations against the Congress party grew louder, the party entailed the services of the propaganda website Alt News to give a clean chit for themselves.

However, in a hurry to give clean chit to the Congress party, Alt News not only did a very poor job with its 'fact-check', but also ended up exposing the links of the Congress party to the toolkit document.",The Print claims Central Vista toolkit is fake after Congress said it is real,5,2021

Towards the end of the conference, the minister marked his objection on one of the statements that were made in an 'open letter' by former bureaucrats last year that has been making rounds on social media platforms.

'This project began, if reports are to be believed, because of a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is 'unlucky''



How someone can put their signature on this bizarre letter defies logic! pic.twitter.com/bdsUfnM1za  Hardeep Singh Puri (@HardeepSPuri) May 31, 2021

In the statement, the bureaucrats had said, 'There is a great deal wrong with the conceptualization of the project. Rather than establishing the necessity of the project with sound prior studies on environmental and technical parameters, this project began, if reports are to be believed, because of a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is 'unlucky', as well as with the thought of leaving a particular government and its leader's impress on the architecture of Delhi.'

Puri rebutted the statement and laid down several facts about the project. He said being retired civil servants with decades of experience, these former bureaucrats should not have believed the reports in the first place and should have looked for the facts. He said, 'These are not educated fools but a disgrace to the country.' He further added, 'I will not put my signatures on a letter that talks about superstitious belief.'

He urged those who are raising questions over the central vista project to at least visit the parliament once and see how difficult it is to sit there due to lack of space. He said, 'The parliament was designed for fewer people. We are making a bigger parliament building for the people of India.' He further said, 'I think some of these guys need to have their head examined before they sign letters like this.'

Puri said they are saying that it was an open letter but I was never made aware of the letter before. It was only on May 31 when he came to know about the contents of the letter. However, it has been making rounds on social media. He further raised question over the alleged news portals that have popped up recently and said, 'I do not know what agenda they have but they need to get their facts right.'

Later, he also shared a snippet of the so-called open letter sent by ex-civil servants.

Once the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment is complete there will be even more space for recreation & for Mummy, Daddy & Pappu to have ice cream there. #OpenLetter pic.twitter.com/zANkCWU9kc  Hardeep Singh Puri (@HardeepSPuri) June 1, 2021

Referring to them as 'vidvaans' (intelligent, learned folks), he said that their contention that the new Central Vista will deprive people of the open space which works as an inexpensive place for recreation is misplaced. 'Once the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment is complete there will be even more space for recreation & for Mummy, Daddy & Pappu to have ice cream there,' he said.

The problem of the false narrative

Union Minister Puri laid down a lot of facts during the press conference. He talked about the false narrative that is being created and propagated around the Central Vista project. He said that majority of those who are opposing the project are calling it a vanity project, insinuating that it is not needed. In reality, they do not even know the difference between Central Vista and Central Vista avenue.

He added that there are misconceptions that old heritage buildings will be demolished to raise new buildings. The narrative, he said, is completely false and the Government of India has repeatedly stated that none of the heritage buildings would be touched.

Only two projects are under construction

At present, only two projects are under construction. The first is the new parliament building and the second is Central Vista avenue. The aim is to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Independence in the new building in 2022. No other projects have yet commenced including the new official residence for the Prime Minister. The estimated cost of the new parliament building is Rs 852 crores and the estimated cost of Central Vista avenue is Rs 477 crore.

UPA-2 had conceptualized the new parliament

Puri added that in 2012, the UPA government had decided to build a new parliament. In the same year, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, then-Union Minister for Rural Development had said, 'We badly need a new parliament building. This one simply isn't functional and is outdated.' When BJP came to power, the project was not only discussed extensively with every stakeholder but every permission had been sought before the project was started on the ground.

The current problems with the Parliament building and government offices

The current parliament building is in a seismic zone 4, said the Union Minister. The existing building would be not able to tolerate strong tremors, making it dangerous. Also, when India got independence in 1947, the population was close to 350 million. At present, the population is around 1.35 billion. The current building is not sufficient for the ample representation of the public. Due to lack of space, delimitation is being postponed for decades. In 2026 delimitation would be done based on the 2021 census. The new parliament building is required so that additional MPs can be accommodated.

Puri further added that the government of India is currently spending Rs.1000 crores on rents on government offices which will be saved once the project is completed in the coming years. He said that the project will provide government offices for 51 ministries with proper urban connectivity. However, it has to noted that the construction work of all the other buildings that are part of this project is yet to be started. No tenders have been floated for the rest of the project including the residence of the Prime Minister of India. The main aim of the government is to get the parliament building ready so that it can be put in use for the celebration of the 75th anniversary of Independence in August 2022.

: Abraham Maslow

As a management teacher I observe  with pain though  that today journalists and amateur writers have changed their writing instruments. A hammer has replaced the pen and I would like to quote another apt slogan of the Parker Retro 51 pen'Life is too short to carry an ugly pen!', least a hammer.

As criticizers of PM Modi run out of ideas, they are desperately trying for helicopter shots in vain. Even if you want to fly a helicopter in the rarified atmosphere it will not take off, you can keep revving your engine and you will never even take off because rarefied air does not allow you to create the desired pressure. The journalists and opposition are trying to fly in a rarified atmosphere. Without realising it, they call it a stifling atmosphere.

They would sometimes talk of fundamental rights, jobs, economy, and freedom of speech and sometimes use lofty English to say nothing; like someone would say the idea of doing all these is to keep the pot boiling  keeping the masses distracted. Everybody is scared today. But distracted from what? Scared of what?

We have very recently surpassed the economy of our Lords of the Kings in the UK and produced our own indigenous Aircraft carrier, the largest in our fleet today (not named INS MODI but INS VIKRANT). We are heading to be the third largest economy. There is food on the table, no power shortages, inflation well under control, over 200 crores vaccination jabs, Ayushman Bharat gives health coverage to poor people, and by September 2022, India is home to 107 unicorns with a total valuation of $ 340.79 Bn.

India's foreign exchange reserves stand at a healthy $553.11 billion as of the week ended September 2. Over 23,000 Indian students, including some foreign nationals, were evacuated under the direct supervision of four union ministers from war-torn Ukraine. Our foreign policy is on the course, no one can bully us, and we are respected by the world. We are keeping a safe driving distance from the so-called big boys in the game. Is the government trying to hide all this? If yes, then you may be closer to the truth. Hammerwalas are using sniffer dogs to unearth a scam where there is none.

We are gagged they say, yet on every TV channel they keep abusing the government, they write whatever they want with their hammer and tongs on every news portal.

As a management teacher and an author, I always told my students that management and leadership are 'just common sense'.

Tell me why for heaven's sake we could not get an International Yoga Day earlier. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his UN address in 2014, had suggested the date of June 21, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world. This is common sense in action we got it so many decades later! United Nations made 21 June International Yoga Daythis was nothing short of a game changernot a penny spent by us and we were catapulted into the international arena.

All the 'hammerwalas' must have thought 'Why the hell it didn't strike us? Modi baazi maar gaya re!' Har Ghar Tiranga is also just an idea. It worked! Of course, other nations have been doing it for decades ago. 'Par nakal ke liye bhee akaal chahiye'- 'Oops! We missed this one too,' they would have miserably pondered.

As George C. Marshall, former U.S. Army General, noted, 'Morale is a state of mind. It is steadfastness and courage and hope. It is elan and determination.' And right now, the morale and hope of Modi detractors seem to be at their absolute nadir, which is why they are angling for outrage on seemingly benign issues.

Now, you have a problem with 'Kartavyapath'. For god's sake stop asking for only rights, have we ever spoken of our fundamental duties, which are eleven in number? Are these only meant for the armed forces and not every citizen including 'Hammerwalas'.

The popular green spot for the public has been given a complete facelift with sandstone fixtures in this effort.

Don't do hair-splitting, you will lose all your hair. OK, Rajpath was a literal translation of Kingsway, but couldn't we connect it to something more meaningful, more actionable rather than a literal translation? Nahyou need common sense for that too.

A couple of more important landmarks created in recent years. As part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, over 7,000 employees of the Ministry of Defense now move to new office complexes. A senior defence official said 'Since Independence, many of our employees have been working in dilapidated hutments. For the first time, they will move into proper offices. Some of the hutments are over 75 years old and some were stables back then. The existing hutments are spread over 50 acres as against 13 acres for the new modern complexes. The War memorial that was long overdue has also come in this integrated effort. The new parliament has a 150 per cent higher seating capacity and is built to last for 150 years. This is called killing four birds with one stonecommon sense.

India Gate has not been named Modi gate or Rajpath as Shahpath or Modipath whereas Connaught place is now Rajiv Chowk where there was no objection. Every college, road, university, and hospital has only five great namesNehru, Indira, Rajiv and not to miss, Sanjaywhere Gandhi was a necessary appendix and not an annexure. We have not seen anything extraordinary named after V.P. Singh, Lal Bahadur Shastri or Narsimha Raonot even a bus stop for Manmohan Singh as per my knowledge.

Of course, Mayawati has dozens of elephant statues and her own life-size statue in Lucknow. But that was done during her reign in Uttar Pradesh. She probably was acutely aware that given the propensity of Congress to adulate over only the Nehru-Gandhi family, she might as well create statues for herself and her party for posterity to know there existed a leader besides the ubiquitous presence of Gandhi family members.

I feel like humming the song sung by Paul and Mary and later by Trini Lopez.

909,https://www.opindia.com/2021/11/central-vista-sc-rejects-petition-to-stall-project-over-change-in-land-use-supreme-court/,"On Monday (November 22), the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition that sought to challenge the change in land use on a plot in the Central Vista area.

The petitioner named Rajeev Suri had alleged that the said plot of land was a recreational area, which is to be used for constructing the new residences of the Prime Minister and Vice-President as part of the Central Vista Project. He claimed that the change in land use, as directed by the Union of India, violated Article 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty). Suri added that the notification denied recreational opportunities to children and Delhi residents to access green and open spaces in the Central Vista area.

'Respondent No. 1 (Union of India) malafidely issued Notification S.O. 3848 (E) dated 28.10.2020 notifying the change in land use, which will deprive residents of Delhi and citizens of India a vast chunk of highly treasured open and green space in the Central Vista area available for social and recreational activity, stands against Article 21, Right to Life the right to enjoyment of a wholesome life,' the petition read.

Rajeev Suri also claimed, 'The Central Vista is the most cherished open space in New Delhi and perhaps India, a symbol of their nationhood, and the publicness of this cherished open spaces land is being compromised which is a great betrayal of the Public Trust Doctrine.' He had originally filed the petition, seeking quashing of notification allowing change in land use, in March last year. It was rejected by the court on August 28, 2020.

However, the apex Court had asked the petitioner to approach it when a final decision on the matter would be taken. The fresh petition was heard by a 3-Judge Bench, comprising of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar. The Court stated, 'Petitioner has not argued that change in land use is in a malafide manner. It is the argument of the petitioner that since in the past it was a recreational area it should have been retained like that. This cannot be the scope of judicial review.

910,https://www.opindia.com/2021/06/central-vista-project-to-save-1000-crore-rent-each-year-reports/,"Amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding the Central vista project, a government official in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has informed that the project will save 1000 crores worth of rental expenditure each year.

As per reports, the Centre spends a whopping 1000 crore on renting buildings to house various government offices in central Delhi. The Central vista project will accommodate all such offices in the newly constructed buildings. He added, 'Several offices of the central government are scattered in different places and many are in rented buildings that require huge amount. Once entire Central Vista project gets completed, all offices will come under one place. This will not only save the rent, but also have better co-ordinated workplaces.'

Under the central vista project, a total of 10 new buildings will be constructed while existing structures will be demolished on either side of Rajpath. A new Parliament building, MP offices, new residences for PM and Vice-President of India will be constructed while the central vista avenue in Rajpath will be remodelled. The overall cost of the project is estimated to be around 20,000 crores and is likely to be completed by 2026. Reportedly, none of the existing heritage buildings will be demolished as part of the project. Currently, only the new Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue are being built.

Delhi High Court terms Central vista project essential, fines petitioners

Last month, the Delhi High Court had dismissed a plea seeking suspension of Central Vista project work and had imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners for moving a motivated plea.

Raising concerns over the safety of the construction workers amidst the pandemic, a joint petition was filed by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a 'historian' and documentary filmmaker who claimed the work does not fall in the essential category and can be put on hold. However, the Centre had already submitted in their response stating that utmost care had been taken with on-site accommodation and 'access to immediate medical attention and proper care made available on site.

Court's order specified that the DDMA had nowhere in its order prohibited the construction work and that the work is scheduled to be completed by November 2021 as time is of the essence in the contract.

Islamist AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan has written to PM Narendra Modi on Thursday, 'warning' him against demolishing mosques inside govt premises under the Central Vista project. Amanatullah Khan is also the chief of Delhi's Sunni Waqf Board.

In the letter, Khan, the AAP MLA from Okhla, voiced concern that people on social media have shared their fears that some mosques were 'on the verge of being demolished' as a result of the project.

Taking to Twitter, the AAP leader wrote in Hindi: 'Zabta Ganj mosque at Mansingh Road, the mosque at Vice President's residence and the mosque at Krishi Bhawan may face damage due to the Central Vista project. I will discuss the issue with PMO and Hardeep S Puri (Union Housing and Urban Affairs minister). No damage to these mosques will be tolerated.'

Screenshot of Amanatullah Khan's Tweet

Khan stated that he really hoped that the central government would provide assurance within 10 days of receiving his letter that no Waqf property will be demolished or its character altered as a result of the Central Vista project, in order to prevent any legal action.

One of the mosques regarding which the AAP leader has raised concerns is reportedly inside the premises of the Vice President's residence. The other one is at Krishi Bhawan and the third is the Zabta Ganj mosque at Mansingh Road.

Interestingly, after the warning issued by Amanatullah Khan, the Imam of Zabta Ganj mosque at Mansingh Road, Asad Khan Falahi, has assured that there is no threat to the mosque and asked people of his community not to fall for fake news and propaganda circulating on social media.

The cleric said that he has had a word with the administration and also has the documents and blueprint of the Central Vista Project. He assures that the mosque will not be affected in any manner during the Central Vista construction. He urges Muslims not to be fooled by unfounded rumours.

AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan and his Hinduphobia

Aam Aadmi Party legislator Amanatullah Khan is known for his antics to flare up communal tension by his Islamist politics.

Amanatullah Khan, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), recently made a veiled genocidal remark about Hindus while remarking on the country's rampant mucormycosis (black fungus) epidemic. In his tweet on Saturday (May 22), Khan wrote, 'Orange fungus is the root of other fungi in the society.' His carefully worded tweet was aimed at mocking the saffron colour, which is linked with the Hindu religion.

On April 7, Aam Aadmi Party legislator and Amanatullah Khan threatened violence against Hindu priest Swamy Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, the Mahant of Dasna Temple over his alleged remarks against Prophet Muhammad.

In accordance with the Sharia (Islamic law), AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan had earlier issued a death threat calling for the beheading of Swamy Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati.

Taking action against his tweet which called for the beheading of the temple priest, Delhi Police had registered an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s MLA Amanatullah Khan.

Similarly, in the violence which erupted on December 15, 2019, when Islamist mobs rampaged across the national capital under the guise of anti-CAA protests, Amanatullah Khan was seen leading the disturbances in Jamia Nagar. That same day, chants of 'Hinduon se Azadi' were heard in the same place. During the violent riots, buses were also set on fire. The Delhi Police raided Jamia Millia Islamia University on the same night, entering the campus to apprehend the criminals.","'Don't touch any mosque during Central Vista renovation, we will not tolerate': AAP's Amanatullah Khan",6,2021

Justice Khanwilkar further said that the selection and appointment of the environmental consultant in the case was just and proper. The Court upheld the clearance from the Ministry of Environment for the project and gave a green signal to move ahead with the construction. Justice Khanwilkar further confirmed the modification regarding the change in land use of plot 228 of the master plan of Delhi and zonal development plan for zones C& D.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna said that he had a different opinion on the grant of land use, as there was no prior approval of the heritage conservation committee and thus matter remitted back for a public hearing. However, he agreed on the issue of the award of the project.

The liberal meltdown

Though the project is essential as in upcoming delimitation exercise, the number of Lok Sabha members is expected to rise to 800 from current 543, it was getting delayed even though the speaker had approved it in 2012. Since the project was announced, several sections of the so-called 'liberal' bubble were questioning the government's intentions making it look like the Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to 'rewrite the history'.

After the Court gave a green signal on January 5, the liberal world had a massive meltdown. Congress loyal Srivatsa said that the Apex Court has upheld the project to 'please PM Modi'.

914,https://www.opindia.com/2021/06/sculptor-anish-kapoor-hindu-taliban-narendra-modi-aurangzeb-central-vista-project-the-guardian/,"The Guardian on Friday provided platform to 'eminent' sculptor Anish Kapoor to foment Hinduphobia and peddle propaganda against the incumbent Indian Government. In his article, Kapoor compared the NDA Government at the Center to 'Hindu Taliban' and claimed that the Central Vista Project was an effort to 'de-Islamify India'.

Anish Kapoor claimed, 'Unsurprisingly, the Islamic origin of these buildings offends the current regime in Delhi. It is why the tyrant Modi and his henchmen are destroying it.' In reality, not a single heritage building will be demolished for the project.

Also, the language used here is enough indication of the animosity Anish Kapoor bears towards Narendra Modi. Given the animosity, it is only natural that he will reach wildly incorrect conclusions.

The Guardian article

Kapoor further continues, 'It is an abomination that Modi's hate-filled campaign to de-Islamify India is allowed to continue via the destruction of a world-class monument. Astonishingly, the UN heritage forum is silent and world heritage bodies have kept their mouths firmly closed.'

The UN heritage forum is silent because not a single heritage monument is being demolished. Also, the UN does not have any locus standing to comment on Indian internal matters. Given the factual inaccuracies in the article, it is quite astonishing that it passed the editorial muster of The Guardian.

Another matter to be addressed here is the claim that the buildings have 'Islamic origins'. It is a matter of fact that the buildings to be demolished were built after independence, so how could they have 'Islamic origins'? Or is it his claim that the Congress rule essentially represented Islamic rule over India?

Also, buildings like the Krishi Bhawan, Shashtri Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan are quite ugly rectangular edifices, not emblematic of great architecture by any measure. Thus, his overbearing fondness for them is quite amusing indeed.

Other gems from the article

Anish Kapoor also proceeded to call architect Bimal Patel a Nazi. He wrote, 'Modi has appointed third-rate Bimal Patel as his architect. Patel will design its replacement much in the way that Albert Speer followed his F�hrer's lead, but, of course, Patel does not have an iota of Speer's talent.'

Is this The Guardian's policy now? To provide platform to the unedited ramblings of a deluded mind to make libelous accusations against a professional? Kapoor did not stop there and compared the Central Vista Project to the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

The claim is so ridiculous that one can only laugh at it in derision. The Central Vista Project has been cleared to proceed by the Indian Judiciary itself. Furthermore, the need for a new Parliament was first highlighted by the Congress party.

Without any evidence, he claims, 'The Indian courts have been pressured to acquiesce to this idiotic scheme and journalists and other commentators have been intimidated.' Kapoor also said that Narendra Modi is the 'Aurangzeb of our times'.

The Mughal tyrant is infamous for his Jihadist ideology which motivated him to demolish Hindu Temples. He further said, 'Modi's Hindu Taliban needs monuments to itself in order to establish cultural acceptance and domination. Like all fascist-leaning politicians, Modi hopes that by controlling the images at the heart of the nation, he will form a new vision of his India, which places him at the centre alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel.'

The rant concluded with, 'The destruction of the parliament buildings represents the taking-over of the Indian psyche by a fascist regime. Its ultra-nationalist vision is of Hindu dominion over all Indians at any price, and Modi as its architect will rule India with his right hand raised in salute, palm open, mimicking the Hindu god Vishnu  among others.'

Not the first time Anish Kapoor has ranted against the Central Vista Project

It is not the first time that the 'eminent' sculptor has ranted against the project. In May, he wrote for The Guardian, 'The high court of India has been coerced into giving the go ahead to this hair-brained scheme in the last few weeks without consultation or due process.'

That particular rant included gems such as 'Modi and his fascist government have commissioned architect Bimal Patel to redesign this central vista. This without consultation or any understanding or regard to the importance of Lutyens design.' And 'Architecture is an effective propagandist tool.'

At least, he was honest enough to admit that his attachment towards the Lutyens architecture is due to its propaganda value.

Not the first time Kapoor has called BJP 'Hindu Taliban'

The sculptor has been calling the BJP 'Hindu Taliban' since at least 2015. It was in 2015 that he said, 'A Hindu version of the Taliban is asserting itself.'

He had said in the article for The Guardian, 'India is a country of 1.25 billion people, including 965 million Hindus and 170 million Muslims. We have a long tradition of tolerance and, despite differences, have managed to pull our huge country together. But the government's militant Hinduism risks marginalising other faiths and tearing apart these bonds. Many of us dread what might then happen.'

Anish Kapoor supports Teesta Setalvad

Interestingly, and perhaps not so surprisingly, Anish Kapoor also supports Teesta Setalvad. In the 2015 article, he said that Setalvad was being 'harassed' and 'threatened' with sedition charges. He described Setalvad as someone who 'still seeks justice for the victims of communal violence in the state of Gujarat in 2002'.

Perhaps, he is not aware, or is deliberately feigning ignorance, but Setalvad is accused of siphoning off the funds meant for the Gujarat Riot victims. In 2015, the CBI had conducted searches at her residence and office related to the matter.","Sculptor Anish Kapoor calls BJP 'Hindu Taliban', PM Modi 'Aurangzeb'",6,2021

As part of the Central Vista project, army establishments located in the central vista area have been relocated to the new Defence Offices Complexes built at Kasturba Gandhi Marg & Africa Avenue in New Delhi. At present, the army offices in the central vista area are located in hutments, which were actually temporary houses, barracks and horse stables built by the British during the Second World War. For the last several decades, part of India's army establishments were operating from these dilapidated houses.

According to the Central Vista Development project, these hutments, along with several office buildings housing various ministries, will be demolished, and new Secretariate Office buildings will be built in their place, which will house all the secretariate employees of all the central ministries. When completed, the project will save a whopping Rs 1,000 crore per year, as at present several ministry officers function from private buildings in Delhi. Heritage buildings, including the current Parliament House, North Block and South Block will not be demolished.

'Those who were behind the Central Vista project with sticks in their hand are cunningly quiet that this (defence Offices Complexes) is also the part of the Central Vista project where infrastructure is being developed for more than 7000 army officials. Because they knew that the moment the truth will be known they will not be able to bluff people anymore. But the country is watching what we are doing in the name of Central Vista,' Narendra Modi said while addressing the gathering.

The PM also asked why the media never wrote about the poor condition of defence offices running for hutments at Raisina Hill.

PM Narendra Modi added that those spreading lies about the Central Vista were not concerned about the conditions in which armed forces personnel were working. The new office complexes constructed by Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry have an office space of 9.60 lakhs sq feet which is far spacious and superior to the old offices at the Raisina Hills.

Narendra Modi added that the two new multi-storey office complexes built on the Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue will make it convenient for armed forces to operate and discharge their duty towards national security in a better way. The prime minister said that this defence office is a step towards the development of a modern defence enclave in the national capital. 'This is a big and important step,' he said.

PM Narendra Modi further added that the entire world is now watching the Central Vista is being established on the pedestals of modern technology. It aims to provide quality infrastructure to army officials working 24X7. The Prime Minister said that at a time when 'we are focusing on ease of living and ease of doing business, modern infrastructure plays an important role in this,' and added that the Central Vista reflects that spirit of ease of living and doing business.

PM Modi said that the Defence Offices Complexes project was completed in 12-13 months against an estimated time of 48 months. The new defence office complexes will accommodate around 7,000 officials from the ministry of defence and the Armed Forces, including the Army, Navy and Air Force. Apart from offices, the complexes also include residential and lodging facilities for employees and visitors.

The Prime Minister sounded confident that the new Parliament building would also be completed in time.

The completion of the first leg of the project and the commission of the overall project is not a small achievement at a time when the Covid 19 pandemic had emerged as a huge challenge before the nation coupled with the opposition parties that had left no stone unturned to scuttle this project.

Breaking barriers of absurdity, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress had called the Central Vista a criminal wastage and the rest of the opposition too was on Pied Piper way.

A self-proclaimed translator Anya Malhotra and herself proclaimed historian friend Sohail Hashmi had filed a petition at Delhi High Court to stop the ongoing work stating that as part of the Covid 19 protocols the construction work can't be undertaken.

916,https://www.opindia.com/2021/06/sc-dismisses-petition-against-delhi-hc-central-vista-order-slams-petitioners/,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal filed against the May 31 judgment of the Delhi High Court refusing to halt the construction of the Central Vista redevelopment project amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Bench comprising of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose lashed out at the petitioners for targeting a single public project when construction activities for similar projects are in progress everywhere else.

Justice Maheshwari pointedly questioned Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners on why was this one project singled out. 'Was honest research conducted about the kinds of construction work that were going on? Is that reflected in your petition?' he asked.

Referring to annexures in the plea, Luthra responded, 'We had challenged the permission obtained for Central VistaWe also placed on record the DDMA order which permitted the on-site construction. We placed on record the permission letter from CPWDmovement passes issued were also placed stating it should be allowed as it is an essential service. We stated that it is not an essential service.'

However, the Bench repeatedly made it clear that the project activities were proceeding in compliance with all protocols as observed in the High Court judgement.

'Your concern was the project is non-compliant. But when there is a finding that it is compliant then how is the petition being pursued?' said Justice Khanwilkar concluded.

Luthra then argued that his plea to halt construction was at a time when the pandemic was raging. The Bench then questioned his intention to file an appeal against the High Court order since Luthra claimed his concern was only limited to a certain period and that his concern was responded to by the government and the High Court.

'More particularly, it is during the pendency of the petition, it was placed on record that project was fully complied. This affidavit was not challenged. Despite that, the Petitioners pursued the petition for reasons best known to them,' read the order.

Shifting the goalpost, Luthra also questioned the fine levied against his clients and petitioners Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a 'historian' and documentary filmmaker.

Clarifying that the fine cannot be waived off considering the plea was highly motivated, the order concluded, 'They cannot now challenge the findings of HC whose opinion is a possible view. The imposition of Rs. 1 lakhs by HC was on the basis that petition only with regard to one public project and was motivated. We dismiss the plea.'

The Court eventually went on to dismiss the appeal, stating that no interference with the Delhi High Court judgment was warranted.

'Questionable PILs have caused problems to our system. PIL has its own sanctity and is for all of us. But, this is not the way to pursue this,' remarked Justice Maheshwari before dismissing the plea.

This visit was not announced earlier and the images of the PM spending time inspecting the construction site went viral in the media and social media.

As the PM's unannounced visit to the Central Vista construction site drew positive reactions from the public, hailing the PM for his dedication to work and commitment, the usual gang was instantly triggered, as expected.

The Indian National Congress chose to attack the PM on misplaced priorities. They accused the Central government of spending on the Central Vista while 'ignoring' the plight of common Indians. Keeping up to its 7-year-old habit of perpetual whining, Congress claimed the Modi government is focusing on the Central Vista exclusively, without any basis.

Meanwhile, here's a May report on how the Congress-led Rajasthan government refused to acknowledge and compensate the death of 350 frontline warriors. As per a Dainik Bhaskar ground report, the state of Rajasthan has given compensation to just 6 health workers out of the 350 who succumbed to Covid-19 while on duty, refusing to acknowledge the sacrifice of the rest.

'Modi has time & enthusiasm to visit & inspect new Parliament & Vista. His vanity projects. Has anyone seen PM Modi meet or visit 1 Hospital during the 2nd wave? 1 Corona Warrior? 1 jobless youth? 1 suffering Farmer? Modi is the most heartless Prime Minister in Indian History,' Tweeted Congress leader Srivatsa.

Of course, it was not of benefit for the Congress leader to talk about the hundreds of meetings PM Modi initiated with countless frontline warriors, doctors and health workers from across the nation since the past year.

PM Modi's constant, daily interactions with administrative officials, health experts, CMs of the states, to coordinate the supply of medicines, oxygen and all essential items all over the country while effectively carrying on the vaccination drive and fight against Covid was obviously missed by Congress.

Nor the Prime Minister's personal meetings with vaccine manufacturers would have fit his propaganda. Let's not forget the more than ten rounds of discussions held by the Union Minister Narendra Tomar with the dissenting politician-cum-farmers.

Sharing an image of Nehru at a construction site, Deepak Sharma the editor of Desh 24�7 Tweeted, 'Nehru at Bhakra (Nangal) Dam site 1954 Modi at Central Vista site 2021 Priorities clearly reflect the vision for India!!'

Though Sharma did not specify what did he mean by comparing the two images, let us just leave it here that there are plenty of Nehru photographs that make clear how the priorities of the two PMs differ. PM Modi certainly does not have some special 'skills' that Nehru had. Congress leaders and supporters may not like those 'skills' being discussed in the media.

Zubair probably thought that the common occurrence of the words 'Without prior intimation and security detail' in the tweets shared about the visit must point towards grand planning by the BJP PR and IT cell.

PM Modi's visit to Central Vista construction site

The Prime Minister in an unannounced visit reportedly spent an hour at the Central Vista project site and carried out a first-hand inspection of the construction status of the new Parliament building. The new project is expected to be completed and operational by December 2022.

918,https://www.opindia.com/2021/06/central-vista-hysteria-congress-rajasthan-govt-to-inaugurate-construction-projects-worth-crores/,"Since the Modi administration announced the much-needed ambitious project, Rahul Gandhi and his Congress party have been lobbying against the Central Vista plans, coercing the central government to abandon the plans for the project. While the Gandhi scion had called the redevelopment of Central Vista a 'criminal wastage', his coterie Shashi Tharoor had also rubbished the idea of the Central Vista Project.

Although the Congress scion and his acolytes have generated a ruckus in order to halt the ongoing reconstruction of Central Vista, calling it a wastage of public funds, interestingly, the Congress party-led government in Rajasthan has given a nod for redevelopment work worth over Rs 125 crores in the state.

An advertisement published by the Rajasthan government showed that the Rajasthan CM and Congress stalwart Ashok Gehlot would be laying the foundation stone of three such multi-crore projects in Jodhpur, Rajasthan on June 3rd, 2021.

Advertisement published by Rajasthan Congress

The first project is the construction of a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) for which the state government has approved a budget worth Rs 45 crores. Second is the construction of an 'International standard' auditorium for which a budget of Rs 60 crore has been approved. The third is the renovation and up-gradation of Baraktullah Khan stadium for which the state government has sanctioned a sum of Rs 20 crores. In total, the state government has approved a budget of Rs 125 crores for redevelopment work in Jodhpur.

Apart from these, other projects totally several crores were also listed in the Rajasthan Congress ad.

As soon as the Rajasthan Congress Government's advertisement surfaced online, Netizens fumed and slammed the Congress leadership over their hypocrisy. Social media users commented that while Congress is crying hoarse over the alleged 'wastage of public funds' in the Central Vista project in the midst of the pandemic, the party itself is splurging same funds in Rajasthan where they rule, spending crores on redevelopment projects.

The Congress government had displayed similar hypocrisy when, amid the raging pandemic, the Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government floated tender seeking bids for the redevelopment of MLA hostel Manora at Nariman Point at an estimated cost of Rs 900 crore.

The Maharashtra government's redevelopment tender aroused concerns in the state, with critics pointing to the government's excessive spending, especially at a time when the state is suffering financial difficulties due to the ongoing pandemic.

Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi stayed away from questioning the Maharashtra government about the expenditure of Rs 900 crore on the construction of luxury apartments for legislators or grilling the Rajasthan government for approving redevelopment work worth Rs 120 crores at a time as critical as this. Nevertheless, the Congress leader was unwavering when it came to politicising the development projects in the national capital, attacking the Modi government over the ambitious Central Vista project, which was planned and funded even before the Chinese virus began wreaking havoc in India.","Congress boasts about construction projects in Rajasthan, but calls Central Vista 'wastage'",6,2021

The majestic 6.5 meters tall cast of the National Emblem is made of bronze and weighs around 9,500 KG. Located on the top of the Central Foyer of the New Parliament Building, the statue has a supporting structure that weighs around 6,500 KG.

This morning, I had the honour of unveiling the National Emblem cast on the roof of the new Parliament. pic.twitter.com/T49dOLRRg1  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 11, 2022

As per the official statement, the concept sketch and process of casting the National Emblem went through eight different stages of preparation, from clay modelling and computer graphics to bronze casting and polishing.

Congressis and 'Liberals' find issues with of the 'roar,' 'canine teeth,' and 'angry face'

As soon as the reports of the unveiling of the cast were made on social media, the usual suspects saw a great opportunity to criticize the cast for unrealistic reasons. Aandolanjeevi and Advocate Prashant Bhushan said the lion's faces on the emblem had been changed from peaceful to angry. He said, 'From Gandhi to Godse; From our national emblem with lions sitting majestically & peacefully; to the new national emblem unveiled for the top of the new Parliament building under construction at Central Vista; Angry lions with bared fangs. This is Modi's new India!'

Congress leader Srinivas BV also pointed out the alleged change as if he is not aware that lions possess teeth and they do roar. He published two photographs of National Emblem where the lions were 'not roarring' in the first one but roaring in the second. He said, 'What has been changed in the country since 1950 is visible in seeing old and new Ashoka Stambha.'

The National Emblem

The National Emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of King Ashoka at Sarnath. The original Ashoka Stambha has four lions mounted back to back on a circular abacus. It rests on a bell-shaped lotus. It contains sculptures of an elephant, a horse, a bull, and a lion separated by Dharma Chakras. You can only see three lions mounted on the abacus with a Dharma Chakra in the centre, a bull on the right, and a horse on the left.

Source: kevinstandagephotography

This profile of the Lion Capital was adopted as the National Emblem of India on January 26, 1950. The bell-shaped lotus was omitted from the Ashok Stambha in the official adaptation as National Emblem. It also contains the motto Satyameva Jayate written in Devanagari script below the profile of the Lion Capital, which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs.'

Why are liberals wrong?

The liberals are claiming that the Government of India has 'changed' the National Emblem and made it look angry and furious with visible' fangs'. They also published photographs of a National Emblem statue that has a 'calmer' face and no teeth visible. However, when we see the original Lion Capital from Sarnath that was made over 2,300 years ago, it is notable that the mouths of the lions are open, and the teeth are clearly visible.

So if the real Ashok Stambha or the Lion Capital is very much similar to the cast of the National Emblem unveiled by PM Modi, how are liberals claiming that the National Emblem has 'calmer-looking' lions that too with images? The photograph they are sharing is of the National Emblem from the top of the Vidhan Sabha building in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

The National Emblem statue of Vishan Sabha, Bengaluru, is very much different from the Lion Capital that was adapted as National Emblem in 1950. The real National Emblem has lions with open mouths, and teeth are clearly visible, which is not the case with the Bengaluru Vidhan Sabha building's National Emblem.

Lions are fierce, they have teeth and they roar, whether you or I like it or not

The liberals are complaining that the lions of the National Emblem cast on the new parliament building look fierce. Also, they are 'shocked' to see 'fangs' visible in the photographs. First of all, the lion is a carnivorous animal. It is fierce and aggressive when it needs to be. You cannot expect it to be 'calm' just because you are scared of the majestic roar. Secondly, it is a huge cast. Prime Minister Modi is hardly as tall as the base of the emblem, and the photograph was clicked from a lower angle, making the open mouth and teeth more prominent.

If you stand under a lion with an open mouth and click its photograph, you are going to see the teeth. You cannot expect it not to scare you with its roar or aggressive looks. If you click the same lion from the front when it is looking down, the teeth will not be visible. It is just the perspective of the camera that you were able to see and focus on the teeth.

Lions do need their teeth, they need to hunt. It is the normal, natural state of a lion to possess long sharp teeth and roar. It is absolutely moronic to pretend that lions need to be toothless to appear 'calm' because some 'liberal' sensibilities get hurt by the sight of a roaring lion.

Liberals and their hate for the Central Vista project

The liberals have spoken against the Central Vista project in length. They have tried to halt the construction, and they tried to do it 'legally' using the judiciary, but they failed miserably. The main parliament building will be complete soon. The other buildings that will house the offices of the ministries are also being constructed, which will save hundreds of crores in rent every year. Instead of lauding the idea of saving public money, they are consistently trying to find faults in the project.","National Emblem: Dear 'Liberals', lions do have long, sharp teeth, whether you want to see them or not",6,2021

'Does anyone know how Tatas were selected for building the new Parliament complex? Was it by bids or like in 2G Spectrum scandal on first come first served basis?', Tweeted Subramanian Swamy, wondering whether the Tata Projects limited won the contract through a fair bid or the contract was a scam, perhaps like the 2G spectrum scam under the UPA coalition government.

Subramanian Swamy's Tweet dated December 14

However, Swamy's insinuations seem misplaced.

Why aspersions made by Dr Subramanian Swamy are wrong

Tata Projects Ltd was amongst the 7 companies which had placed pre-qualification technical bids for the construction of the new building in the month of July. A senior official aware of the development had then confirmed that seven firms had submitted their bids, which were to be considered. 'It will take two to three weeks to shortlist the bidder based on their technical qualifications,' the official had added while speaking to Hindustan Times.

Mumbai-based construction and civil engineering company ITD Cementation India Limited, Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, Larsen & Toubro Limited, NCC Limited (headquartered in Hyderabad), PSP Projects Ltd based in Ahmedabad, Tata Projects Ltd and Uttar Pradesh state government undertaking UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited had filed their bids online seeking to construct the new Parliament complex, adjacent to the existing Parliament building, with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 square meters.

On August 12, three construction companies have qualified for submission of financial bid. These companies were L&T Ltd, Tata Project Ltd and Shapoorji Pallonji and Co Pvt Ltd.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) then opened the financial bids for the new Parliament building construction on September 16, 2020. The government civic body had estimated a cost of Rs 940 crore for the project. Tata Projects had submitted the lowest bid of Rs 861.90 crore. Larsen and Toubro's bid was at Rs 865 crore. Since Tata Projects Ltd's bid was the lowest, it won the construct to build the new Parliament building.

The New Parliament Building

The new building will come up at plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, according to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which said the existing building will continue to function during this period. It will comprise of halls with larger seating capacity for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and offices for members of Parliament as well as a courtyard, dining facilities, and a lounge for the politicians.

The contract for the new Parliament building was to be awarded in March but was delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The construction of this new complex is a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government's ambitious Central Vista Redevelopment Project.

Modi Govt's Central Vista redevelopment project

The Central Vista project involves the redevelopment of the area known as Central Vista Avenue, the area between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate, where all the important buildings related to the union government are located. This project has two main parts, a new parliament building, and a new secretariat complex to bring all the central govt ministries in one place. A third part involves the development of the Rajghat and the area around it, which is available for the general public, including the development of public amenities. This project will involve demolition of some non-heritage buildings in the area, and construction of new buildings in place of them.

Like most of the initiatives taken by the Central government, the proposal to construct the new parliament building has also irked the 'secular' forces in the country. While the Congress went ahead to boycott the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the new Parliament building on December 10, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra had expressed displeasure on the Bhumi Pujan saying that the Prime Minister of a country should lay the foundation stone and not perform Bhumi Pujan, in a 'secular' multi-faith democracy.

Actor Kamal Haasan on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should spell out the rationale behind constructing a new Parliament building.

While the so-called liberals continue to cry foul, there are several reasons which completely justify India's need for a new parliament building and a central secretariat complex. The old building is not only posing safety issues, it is inadequate to serve the need of a tech-savvy, rapidly developing democracy. Many parts of the building are crumbling and the earthquake vulnerability of the area in Delhi makes a new, better-designed structure the need of the hour.","Dr Subramanian Swamy, here is how Tata Group was selected to construct the new parliament building",6,2021

Taking to Twitter, Rahul Gandhi said that the redevelopment of Central Vista is a 'criminal wastage' and asked Prime Minister Modi to put 'people's lives at the centre' and not to further the 'blind arrogance to get a new house'.

It is important to note that the redevelopment project of Central Vista, i.e., the redesigning of the existing central secretariat offices in the national capital, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a new common central secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President.

Ever since the much-needed ambitious project was launched by the Modi government, Rahul Gandhi and his Congress party have been indulging in politicising the issue by asking the government to shelve its plans on the central vista project. While Rahul Gandhi is busy preaching the Modi government over the Central Vista project, the Congress party-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra has now undertaken a project to construct luxury apartments for the MLAs.

MVA government busy spending crores for new MLA houses in Mumbai

At a time when Maharashtra is struggling to handle the coronavirus pandemic, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has floated tender seeking bids for the redevelopment of MLA hostel Manora at Nariman Point at an estimated cost of Rs.900 crore. The redevelopment tender floated by the Maharashtra government has now raised eyebrows in the state as critics are pointing out the wasteful expenditure by the government that comes at a time when the state is facing a financial crunch.

Earlier, the Maharashtra government had entrusted the reconstruction of Manora MLA Hostel in Nariman Point to the central public sector undertaking  National Building Construction Corporation.

In 2017, the then Maharashtra government floated the first tender to reconstruct the Manora MLA complex at Nariman Point in Mumbai at the cost of Rs.400 crore. However, citing delay, the newly elected Maha Vikas Aghadi government had transferred the project to the Maharashtra Public Works Department in December 2020.

As the project got delayed, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has now scrapped the earlier tender and has now put up a new tender by escalating the cost of the project to Rs.900 crores. Speaking to the Times of India, a PWD official said that the cost of the project might escalate further. The electrical work alone is estimated to cost Rs.250 crore, he added.

Reportedly, the proposed MLA hostel, comprising of two towers, is expected to be completed in three years. If built, the hostel will comprise one 42-storey tower and another 28-storey tower with 675 flats in total. Each residence will be spread over 1,000 square feet, of which 600 sq ft will be for the use of the elected representative. The remaining 400 sq ft space can be used for office plus a residence for the personal assistant of the respective MLA and MLC.

The multi-crore project includes the construction of gymnasiums on the terrace, meeting and conference halls, waiting halls for MLA visitors, a canteen, a grocery, a salon, shops, a dispensary and a theatre. The old Manora towers were demolished in 2018 due to their dilapidated condition. Since then, the government has been paying Rs 1 lakh to each MLA per month to find alternate accommodation in the same vicinity.

Instead of questioning the Maharashtra government over the wasteful expenditure of Rs 900 crore on the construction of luxury apartments to its lawmakers during the pandemic, Rahul Gandhi chooses to politicise developmental projects in the national capital and attacks the Modi government over the ambitious Central Vista project that has been planned and funded even before the advent of the Chinese pandemic in the country.","Rahul Gandhi wants Central Vista project scrapped, but MVA govt in Maha is spending over 900 crores for MLA residences",6,2021

Asaduddin Owaisi stated that it was against the 'constitutional norms' for the PM to lead the ceremony, as Lok Sabha is not subordinate to the government'.

Constitution separates powers of parliament, govt & judiciary. As head of govt, @PMOIndia shouldn't have unveiled the national emblem atop new parliament building.

The Wire's boss S Varadrajan objected to the 'Hindu' ceremony. He proclaimed that PM Modi should say his prayers at home and if he wants to do it in the open it should not be at an official event of the Indian Union. He even called the PM a 'repeat offender' in this regard.

So, as per S Varadarajan, doing a Puja is an offence committed by the Prime Minister of India.

The Opposition had its own trauma. Congress fumed that it was not invited to the program, even though it was quite visible that it was a low-key ceremony and not many people were there, even prominent ministers of the government and senior BJP leaders were missing.

Also, Congress has been against the entire Central Vista project and has been fighting it tooth and nail. It was amusing to see that they were fuming over not being invited to the small ceremony of the unveiling of the emblem.

The Left parties went a step ahead. They were more 'team Varadarajan' and proclaimed that the Puja ceremony was wrong. CPM said, 'National Emblem installation should not be linked to religious ceremonies. It is everyone's emblem not those who have some religious beliefs. Keep religion separate from national functions.'

CPM statement

CPM's Sitaram Yechury went a step ahead and straightaway declared the event as 'unconstitutional'. As per Yechuri, the constitution separates the 3 wings of democracy- the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary.

PM unveiling the national emblem on top of the new Parliament building is a clear violation of our Constitution. The Constitution unambiguously separates the 3 wings of our democracy  the Executive (government), the Legislature (Parliament and state assemblies) & the Judiciary. pic.twitter.com/EOEemrZ9qU  Sitaram Yechury (@SitaramYechury) July 11, 2022

Yechury's thought process seems weird. The PM was not there undermining Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, the PM was not overstepping or meddling in any parliamentary process. The PM was not declaring himself as the Supreme Leader of the parliament there. The current parliament runs in the old building. That parliament is NOT IN SESSION as of now.

The Central Vista project is by the Central government. The new parliament building is still under construction and when the new building is functional and Lok Sabha is convened in that new building, Speaker Om Birla will preside over it. The Lok Sabha or its MPs are not funding or managing the construction of the new parliament building, the government is. So the head of the government, the PM, has all the right to preside over any ceremonies associated with the project.

The problem is Hinduphobia, and hatred for PM Modi

In fact, the reason behind most of the negative comments and statements is the same, 'How dare Modi'? How did Modi dare to unfurl a roaring, majestic symbol of Indian sovereignty on the top of a brand new parliament building that will be his legacy in the very heart of Delhi? How dare he flaunt his 'Hinduness' so openly? How dare he 'change' Lutyen's Delhi to India's Delhi?

We have seen similar outbursts of frustration and negativity each time PM Modi lets everyone know that he is not ashamed of his Hindu identity, but he asserts it proudly. Be it the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, the visits to Kedarnath, the Bhoomi Pujan at Ayodhya or the dozens of other instances where PM Modi has let every Indian know that Hindu Dharma is not confined to some narrow religious confines of a mere belief, but it is India's civilisational identity, the Left and its ecosystem suffers a collective meltdown.

There is no reason why a Puja should not be done at an inauguration or unveiling ceremony. Sanatan Dharma is the civilisational fabric of this land, a couple of words forcefully added into the preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency cannot change this truth. We may be secular in our policies, and administration, but India is a Hindu country. The Left should just learn to deal with it.",National Emblem at new parliament building: The Left suffers another meltdown because a Puja was done by PM Modi,6,2021
923,https://www.opindia.com/2021/09/congress-social-media-head-rohan-gupta-morphed-image-pm-modi-central-vista-visit/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after coming back from his 3-day trip to the USA for bilateral meetings and for the UNGA summit, went straight to monitor the construction of the new Central Vista. In an attempt to mock PM Modi, Congress took to Twitter to post morphed images of him walking the construction site of Central Vista.

Rohan Gupta, 'Chairman' of the Social Media Department of Congress posted a morphed image where he showed that a cameraman was lying down on the floor and clicking a picture of PM Modi walking across the construction site of Central Vista. The image was clearly morphed, made to show that PM Modi was taking an update on the Central Vista project as a publicity stunt.

Rohan Gupta posted this image with the caption, 'Photographer of the Month'.


Interestingly, this clearly morphed image was not marked as 'manipulated media' by social media giant Twitter. If one recalls, On 19 May 2021, Congress shot off an email to Twitter, asking the social media behemoth to permanently suspend Twitter accounts of BJP leaders JP Nadda, Sambit Patra, Smriti Irani, BL Santosh and many other functionaries for sharing a toolkit, which they claimed was prepared by the Congress party to sully the reputation of the Modi government amidst the raging COVID-19 outbreak.

The email was sent a day after the BJP leaders had exposed a toolkit that entailed point-by-point instructions for the Congress workers for attacking the Modi government. From maligning the Kumbh Mela and describing it as 'super spreader' to using international media and 'friendly' journalists to defame PM Modi, to blocking beds and hoarding other essential supplies for favourable social media PR, the content of the toolkit included a range of directives for the loyal Congress leaders and supporters to be followed to paint PM Modi and his government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak in a bad light.

Twitter, within a day, had marked the Toolkit images as 'manipulated media' clearly telling people that they thought the image of the toolkit was fake. It is pertinent to note that Twitter had no proof to allege that the toolkit was fake, except the word of Congress itself.

While Twitter was more than happy to oblige Congress and become a part of their Toolkit, the social media giant has failed to take action against Congress functionaries sharing patently morphed images, like the one shared by Rohan Gupta.

Further, not only has Twitter not bothered to mark the fake image as 'manipulated media', but the usual 'fact-checkers' who claim that they uphold the truth, have conveniently missed taking action against this post. BoomLive and AltNews, the self-proclaimed fact-checkers who often give covering fire to Islamists focussed on 'fact-checking' a different fake image instead of the one shared by Congress.

BoomLive, while ignoring this fake image by Congress, 'fact-checked' a clearly fake post where it was claimed that the New York Times praised PM Modi after his visit to the USA.

Fact-checking the image, BoomLive came to the conclusion that the New York Times post was created as a satire.

Fact Check by BoomLive

AltNews, on the other hand, focus on 'fact-checking' random videos of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which were authentic, but according to them, were used to 'show he was disrespected'. Essentially, AltNews wrote a cock-and-bull 'fact check' in an attempt to prove that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were respectful of Manmohan Singh and disprove the video evidence to the contrary that has been available for years.

The fact-check was done by Mohammad Zubair, the AltNews co-founder who is being investigated under POCSO for bullying and doxxing a minor girl.

Fact-check by AltNews

While BoomLive focussed on proving that an image praising PM Modi was satire, AltNews focussed on proving that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi never disrespected former PM Manmohan Singh. In doing so, they clearly did not bother 'fact-checking' an obvious morphed image posted by Congress itself because their fact-checking is meant to serve the purpose either of Islamists or political parties that oppose BJP, PM Modi, or those elements who work against the cause of India itself.

In fact, even Shekhar Gupta's The Print attempted to 'fact-check' the New York Times satire by claiming that the image was 'viral', when it actually was not.

Fact-check by The Print

While the satire image of New York Times was clearly not viral, the 'satire' image posted by Rohan Gupta was shared by several anti-Modi, anti-India elements to mock the Prime Minister, and yet, BoomLive and The Print chose to 'fact-check' the NYT image instead of this one, while POCSO accused Mohammad Zubair chose to eulogise Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

Rohan Gupta, the habitual offender

Earlier in 2017, Rohan Gupta had posted a fake 'survey' predicting poll results, which showed Congress set to sweep the assembly elections that were underway in Gujarat at the time.

Parindu Bhagat, in charge of Gujarat election legal cell, on behalf of BJP leaders had filed a complaint about Rohit Gupta, tweeting an exit poll for the Gujarat Assembly Elections. This 'exit poll' showed Congress getting 65+ seats out of a total of 89 constituencies, in the first phase of the Gujarat election. BJP was pegged to get 22 seats while others were pitted to get 2 seats.

Rohan Gupta's act of posting an exit poll violated the Election Commission's notification which banned the publishing of exit polls till the second phase of voting concluded. Not to mention, that the survey was entirely fake. Rohan Gupta had been booked for the same by the Crime Branch on the instructions of the Election Commission, according to Times of India. That case still appears to be pending.

It is pertinent to note that the IT cell head Rohan Gupta is the son of Congress leader Rajkumar Gupta.","Congress social media head posts morphed image of PM Modi, Twitter doesn't mark it 'manipulated media', fact-checkers let it go",6,2021
924,https://www.opindia.com/2020/12/priests-from-sringeri-perform-bhumi-pujan-of-new-parliament-building-read-details/,"On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the Bhumi Pujan for the new Parliament building, which is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore.

The Central Vista project, one of Modi government ambitious project, involves the redevelopment of the area known as Central Vista Avenue, the area between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate.

The Bhumi Pujan event was performed as per Hindu traditions and several religious ceremonies were scheduled to be held on the occasion of the historic event. A team of priests from Shri Sharada Pitham from Sringeri performed various pujas. Leaders of various other faiths were also present to recite prayers during the foundation laying ceremony.

Reportedly, Union Parliamentary Affairs Ministers Pralhad Joshi was given responsibility by Prime Minister Modi to organise the foundation laying ceremony. PM Modi had personally conveyed Joshi to invite priests to perform religious rituals on Thursday's event. Accordingly, Minister Pralhad Joshi had requested the Jagadguru Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswamiji of the Sringeri Sharada Pitham, who had, in turn, promised to send a team of Vedic scholars and priests to New Delhi.

Team of six priests to perform various Puja

A team of six priests reached the capital on Tuesday to prepare for the pujas to be performed on the occasion of Bhumi Puja ceremony. Acharya V Shivakumar Sharma, KS Lakshmi Narayana Somayaji, KS Ganesh Somayaji, Nagaraja Adiga, Raghavendra Bhatta and Rishyasringa have flown to New Delhi to conduct rituals and Puja as per Hindu traditions on Thursday as PM Modi lays the foundation for the new parliament.

During the ceremony, the priests from Sringeri will perform Guru Puja, Ganapathi Puja, Punyaha Vachana, Adikesha Puja, Anantha Pooja, Varaha Puja and Bhuvaneshwari Puja.

The Sringeri Sharada Peetham has also sent a special 'Shankh' or conch and 'Navarathna Peetam', blessed by Jagadguru himself, to be placed at the foundation of the new parliament project.

A 'sarva dharma prarthana' (inter-faith prayer) was also conducted. Religious leaders of various faiths recited prayers and gave their blessings for the new building.",Priests from Sringeri perform Bhumi Pujan as PM Modi lays foundation stone of new parliament building,6,2021
925,https://www.opindia.com/2022/09/rajpath-kartavya-path-central-vista-king-george/,"The name of New Delhi's historic Rajpath is set to be changed to 'Kartavya Path', media reports said on Monday, September 5, 2022. Rajpath was a Hindi translation of Kingsway, the ceremonial boulevard's name during British rule, named after King George V. He had visited India in 1911 when the decision to move the British Raj's capital from Calcutta to Delhi was formally proclaimed.

The move is in line with the push for decolonisation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent days. Earlier, the Indian Naval ensign was changed this month to remove St George's Cross from the ensign, and the Scottish hymn 'Abide By Me' was removed from the Beating Retreat ceremony during Republic Day celebrations. PM Modi had stressed upon deloconisation during his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort this year.

As per media reports, the decision to change the name is likely to be endorsed by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) later this week.

Rajpath, along with Central Vista avenue, has undergone a major transformation under the Central Vista project. The Central Vista project involves the reconstruction of Central Vista Avenue, which runs between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate and houses all of the union government's significant buildings. This project is divided into two parts: a new parliament building and a new secretariat complex that will house all of the key government departments in one location.

A third component entails the development of the Rajpath and the surrounding region, which is usually accessible to the general public, as well as the creation of public utilities.

926,https://www.opindia.com/2022/01/pm-modi-unveils-the-holographic-statue-of-netaji-subhas-chandra-bose/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi today unveiled the holographic statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate marking the 125th Birth Anniversary of the Illustrious freedom fighter today. The Iconic canopy at the India Gate which once hosted a statue of King George V until 1968, will be hosting the one-of-a-kind holographic statue of Netaji projected by a 4K projector. The hologram will later be replaced by a 28-ft-high permanent jade black statue of Subhas Chandra Bose made in Granite.

The decision to install the Netaji's statue was announced by PM Modi on Twitter, saying it is a 'gesture of India's indebtedness to him'. Earlier in the morning, the Prime Minister paid tributes to the leader in the Central Hall of the Parliament. The event in the evening was graced by the Prime Minister, HM Amit Shah, MoHUA Minister Hardeep Singh Puri among other cabinet ministers, veterans and officials from the armed forces.

The PM in his speech while referring to Netaji as 'the brave son of mother India' emphasised that it was Netaji has instilled in us the belief for free India. He added that Netaji, once in front of the British had said, 'Mein Svatantra ki Bheekh nahi loonga, mein isse hasil karunga' (I'll not accept freedom as a beggar, rather I'll achieve it). Talking about the occasion, the PM said 'The moment is historic and so is this place which very close to the Parliament and also close to the National War Memorial.' PM Modi said the statue is a fitting tribute to Netaji, who established the first Independent government on the soil of India. Soon this hologram statue will be replaced by a granite statue and it will remind us of our National duties and will continue to inspire generations galore.'

Emphasizing the Importance of Disaster Management, The Prime Minister distributed the 'Subhash Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar' for four consecutive years (2019 to 2022) to people who have made excellent contributions by participating in managing disasters like floods, droughts and cyclones which hit the country over the years. Talking about the erstwhile condition of disaster management in the country, Modi lamented, 'Many wouldn't know that earlier Agriculture department used to look after disaster management. Things started changing after Gujarat's 2001 earthquake. Gujarat became the first state to pass the Disaster Management Act. Soon after in 2005, the Govt. of India constituted the NDRF in 2005.'

On the occasion of Parakram Diwas, which marks the birth anniversary of Netaji Bose, the PM recalled the tragedies of cyclones in eastern and western coastal states, earthquakes and floods which stormed the country during the Pandemic. He lauded the efforts of the NDRF and the SDRFs who saved the people stuck in dangerous situations while putting their own lives at stake. 'Today is the day to salute their efforts' he added.

Talking about the steps taken to empower the NDRF, PM Narendra Modi added, 'Along with Relief, Rescue and Rehabilitation we have moved towards Reform in the practices of disaster control. We are strengthening the NDRF and it is spreading its wings to many regions in the country. We have employed the use of space technologies, methods of planning and management while dealing with the arena in a holistic approach.' He further added, 'I've been told that the NDMA's 'Aapda Mitra' scheme is inviting a lot of positive response while people are willing to help when a disaster is struck.' He also added that people no longer want to be 'victims' but 'volunteers' in the disaster management process.

The PM concluded his speech saying, 'I am confident that with our Parakram (valour) & Jan Bhagidari (People's participation), we will be able to build India of Netaji's dreams'.

The installation of Netaji's statue marks yet another change to Central Vista avenue, which has been redeveloped under the Central Vista project. The canopy where the statue is installed is located at the centre of the India Gate Hexagon complex, with the National War memorial located to the east of it and the India Gate to the west. After a wait for decades, the war memorial was finally constructed by the Modi government and it was inaugurated in 2019.

According to govt sources, work on the permanent stone statue will start in the next few weeks and it could take at least five to six months to complete the same. The statue made of black granite from Telangana is expected to be installed by August this year. Talking about the statue, a govt official had said, 'This will be a realistic sculpture made of a single-piece granite stone. The stone has been selected considering the strong character of Netaji.' The official added that the culture ministry had started the project two months ago and the groundwork has been completed.",PM Modi unveils the Holographic statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,6,2021

Statue of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who made a significant contribution to the Indian freedom movement, is being honoured with the statue at the India Gate canopy, which hosted a statue of King George V until 1968. According to an official announcement, the 28 feet tall Netaji sculpture being installed was cut from a 280 MT monolithic granite slab.

The installation of the statue of Netaji was announced by the PM on 21st January this year, and on 23rd January, on the occasion of Netaji's birthday, a hologram statue of Bose was unveiled at the same location by the PM.

Statue of Netaji Bose at India Gate

The granite monolith was sculpted to form a monument weighing 65 MT after 26,000 man-hours of rigorous artistic effort. The statue is entirely hand-sculpted, employing both traditional and contemporary techniques. Arun Yogiraj headed the team of sculptors that created the statue. A 100-foot-long vehicle with 140 wheels was exclusively developed to transport this monolithic granite slab from Khammam, Telangana, to New Delhi.

The Canopy at the India Gate Hexagon was designed by Edwin Lutyens, and it originally housed a marble statue of King George V. The statue was retained in that place for two decades after the independence of India by the Congress government, despite demands to remove it. King George V's statue was finally removed from India Gate in 1968, and was shifted to Coronation Park. Since then, the canopy remained empty, with various proposals to install statues of various personalities, but none of those materialised. The proposals included statues of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and even Indira Gandhi after her death. Finally, it took the Narendra Modi government to install Netaji's statue at the empty canopy.

The arrival of the Prime Minister at the canopy for the installation of Netaji's monument was preceded by traditional Manipuri Shankh Vadayam and Kerala's Panch Vadayam and Chanda. The unveiling of Netaji's statue was accompanied by the traditional INA hymn '��Kadam Kadam Badhaye Jaa.' On September 9, 10, and 11, a unique 10-minute Drone Show on Netaji's life will be shown at India Gate at 8 p.m. All these functions will be free to the public.

Just like replacing Netaji's statue with King George V's statue marked the end of a colonial legacy, another colonial legacy was ended with the renaming of Rajpath as Kartavya Path. During British Raj, this road was known as Kings Way, and it was changed to Rajpath after Independence. Similarly, the Queen's Way was renamed Janpath.

After unveiling the Netaji's statue, the Prime Minister inaugurated the completely redesigned Kartavya Path, formerly known as Rajpath, one of India's most famous roads, which runs from the Rashtrapati Bhavan past Vijay Chowk, India Gate, and ends at the National War Memorial in Delhi. Every year on January 26, the Republic Day parade is held on this road. The renaming was done in accordance with Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address, which advocated for the abolition of colonial symbols.

Central Vista Avenue

After inaugurating the statue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed an exhibition at Central Vista Avenue. During this time, PM Modi met the workers involved in the development of this project and interacted with them. APM Modi told the '��Shramjeevis' that he will invite all of those who worked on the redevelopment project of Central Vista for the 26th January Republic Day parade.

The Central Vista project involves the reconstruction of Central Vista Avenue, which runs between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate and houses all of the union government's significant buildings. The redesigned Kartavya Path is part of the larger central vista redevelopment project, which includes a new parliament building which is already almost complete, new secretariate buildings on both sides of Kartavya Path that will house employees of all ministries of the union govt, new residence and office for the Prime Minister, new residence for the Vice President, a central conference centre, and expansion of the national archive. For 10 central secretariate buildings, existing buildings housing various ministries and the vice-president's residence will be demolished.

The development of central vista included the development of Kartavya Path and the surrounding region, which is usually accessible to the general public, as well as the creation of public utilities. Old trees along the path have been retained, while dead trees have been removed and new trees planted. The lawns on both sides of the path have been redeveloped and stone walkways made in the entire area, so that people don't need to walk on the lawns.

The canals on both side of the road also have been restored, and new bridges have been built over them.

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose '�� The unsung hero of the Indian independence struggle

As various visionaries are recognized as heroes of the Indian Freedom Struggle, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is the one who left a significant legacy but is less renowned than others. Though much is known about Netaji's role in the liberation movement, it is important to remember that it was Netaji who envisioned India that we see today.

A number of facts demonstrate Netaji's repudiation by the mainstream torchbearer party of the Freedom movement. One of them was when Netaji was elected president of Congress in Haripura in 1938. Netaji had been campaigning against the British government's federal concept, as outlined in the Government of India Act 1935. Unlike other sections within the party who were in favor of accepting the new compromises from the British, he had proposed a mass action for 'Purna Swaraj.' However, the old guard, including MK Gandhi, ignored his suggestions.

As a result, he ran for re-election to the presidency in the following annual Congress session, which would be held in Tripuri. Interestingly, Netaji defeated Gandhi's candidate, Pattabhi Sitarammayya (1,575 to 1,376 votes). Consequently, the whole Congress working committee (CWC) resigned. Thereafter, he was shunted out of the Congress party because he had the charisma and ability to win an election against the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi.

The mystery behind Netaji's death

On August 18, 1945, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose inexplicably disappeared when a Japanese aircraft flying him crashed in Taiwan. He is said to have died from third-degree burns. It was never proven, though.

Because his final days are unknown, there are various speculations concerning his location and what happened to him. Some allege that Netaji Bose was in Russia until at least 1968. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy further alleged that Stalin was involved in 'murdering' Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who did not die in an aircraft accident in 1945. He further asserted that Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was aware that Bose was being held captive in Russia before to his murder. India had requested that Russia inquire into any Bose-related information they may have, yet it was futile.",PM Modi unveils statue of Netaji Bose and revamped Kartavya Path,6,2021

'Today is a historic day as the foundation of the New Parliament building has been laid. We the people of India together will construct this new building of the Parliament,' Prime Minister Modi in his national address after performing Bhumi Pujan for the new parliament.

The Prime Minister also added that it is a proud day for over 130 crores Indians for witnessing the historic moment. The new Parliament building is an example of the co-existence of the new and the old and an effort to make changes within oneself in accordance with the time and needs, PM Modi added.

In his address after laying the foundation stone for a new Parliament building at Central Vista, PM Modi said that he still remembers the day he had entered the Parliament building as the newly elected Prime Minister of India in 2014.

'I can never forget the moment in my life when I had the opportunity to come to Parliament House for the first time in 2014 as an MP. Then, before stepping into this temple of democracy, I had bowed my head and saluted this temple of democracy,' he said.

Prime Minister Modi also said that the new Parliament will fulfil the needs of a 21st century India. Addressing the people during the inauguration, he added, 'This old building has seen many renovations over the last hundred years, now the building is seeking rest. It is our responsibility to give 21st century India a new parliament building.'

'The new parliament is an amalgamation of the old and new,' PM Modi addressing the nation as he pointed how the new building is an intrinsic part of the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and will be a landmark opportunity to build peoples' Parliament for the first time after independence.

The Prime Minister also mentioned that many new ideas are being implemented in the new Parliament House, which will increase the efficiency of the MPs.

Those who doubted our nation's future have been proven wrong: PM Modi

PM Modi said that the people of the country will take pride in the building. He also remembered how doubts were raised on the future of the nation during the independence movement. Forecasts were made that democracy will not be successful in India. Today we can say with pride that we have proved the naysayers wrong, PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister praised India's spirit of democracy, saying that it has been sacred and a way of life in the country that has been developed based on centuries of experience.

He also said that other countries discuss elections and other administrative issues when speaking about democracy and said that a day is not far when these countries will say 'India is the mother of democracy'.

Democracy in India is constantly being renewed

Prime Minister Modi also pointed out how democracy has been constantly renewed in the country and added that the evolution in the country can be seen through higher voter turnouts in every election.

'Usually, when democracy is discussed elsewhere, it is about election procedures, governance and administration. Putting more emphasis on these systems is called Democracy. Democracy is a culture in India. Democracy is a life value, a way of life and the soul of the life of the nation for India. Democracy of India is a system developed with the experience of centuries,' PM Modi said in his national address.

Differences strengthen democracy

After laying the foundation stone to the new parliament, PM Modi emphasised the need for strengthening democracy by accepting differing views and perspectives. He added that democracy in India has always been a means of resolving differences along with governance.

'Different views, different perspectives, they empower a vibrant democracy. There is always room for differences but there should never be a disconnect, our democracy has moved ahead with this goal. We are there to serve the public, there should be no differences in this ultimate goal,' PM Modi.

He continued, 'Debates are held within Parliament or outside Parliament. The determination to serve the nation, dedication to the national interest should be reflected constantly.'

Coming generations will be proud to see new Parliament House: PM Modi

PM Modi also added just as the National War Memorial that has created a new identity beyond India Gate, the new Parliament House will establish its own identity. The coming generations will be proud to see the new Parliament House that is built-in independent India. It is built after commemorating 75 years of independence, PM added.

Concluding his speech, the Prime Minister said that we will have to take the pledge of 'India First' and our decisions should make nation stronger and be measured on the same scale  that nation's welfare comes first.

'Our efforts in next 25-26 yrs should be towards how do we want to see India in 2047, in our 100 years of Independence,' the Prime Minister said.

While the entire country is busy celebrating the victory of our heroes and congratulating them, the Congress leader chose to use this happy occasion to criticise the important infrastructure projects in the country.

In an attempt to sound serious about preparing for the next Olympics in 2024, P Chidambaram said that the sports bodies much start working now. However, for the funding of the sports activities, he suggested that the money allocated to various projects like Central Vista, Bullet Train and other 'vanity projects' should be diverted to sports.

P Chidambaram said that these projects 'can wait or suffer a cut of 25 per cent', implying that the entire amount allocated to them, or at least 25%, should be diverted to sports. He also said that the government should pay for taking part in international competitions.

This is a very strange comment coming from a former union finance minister, as he is speaking the language of ordinary trolls. As a finance minister, he should be aware that there are budgetary allocations under various heads, and a government of a large country like India can't stop one sector to fund another.

Just like paying billions will not produce 260 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine in a day, spending billions only will also not result in more medals. Success in international sports is achieved after long preparations, and the money is only a part of it. Surely the government can increase the budgetary allocation for sports, but this does not mean the govt will have to deduct the amount from other activities like infrastructure development. It may not sound right on this day, but actually, infrastructure development can be considered a higher priority sector than sports.

Moreover, fund in some of the projects by Chidambaram is locked, which can't be diverted. The Mumbai Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor project is being financed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at a very low-interest rate, and the loan is meant for the rail project only. A former union finance minister is expected to know that amount received for financing a rail project can't be diverted to another sector like sports.

It is also amusing that a senior politician of the country considers infrastructure development projects as 'vanity projects'. The Congress party has been criticising the central vista project as unnecessary, but its own government had said that a new and bigger parliament house is immediately needed, as the existing parliament house is not in good shape, and it can't accommodate the increased number of MPs which is due very soon. Similarly, the central secretariate project is also aimed at saving money for the govt, as around 1,000 crore is being paid annually as rentals for various govt offices housed in private properties in Delhi.

Courts have junked several petitions opposing the Central Vista project, that would not stop the Congress leaders to continue opposing it on baseless grounds.",P Chidambaram says infrastructure funds should be diverted to sports,6,2021

So, what is the Centra Vista project?

The Central Vista redevelopment project is a construction plan to give India's power corridor a new spatial identity in what is usually called the Lutyen's Delhi. The existing buildings for Parliament, various offices of the central government, the residence of the prime minister and also the vice-president's house, in the view of the government, have been found to be inadequate. New buildings will be constructed along the Rashtrapati Bhavan-India Gate stretch of the Rajpath in New Delhi.

Under the Central Vista project, the residence of the prime minister is likely to be shifted near the South Block that houses the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The vice-president's new house will be closer to the North Block. The 'North' and 'South' Blocks are named so for their location north and south of the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

According to the Central Vista redevelopment plan, North and South Blocks will be converted into museums. However, the current residence of the vice president is among the buildings identified for demolition.

Highlights of the Central Vista project

The new Parliament Building Complex, triangular in shape spread over 64,500 square metre, is described as the pivot of the Central Vista project design. It is to be much bigger than the existing Parliament building and will be able to house 1,224 Members of Parliament.

The Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity of 888 MPs while the Rajya Sabha chamber will accommodate 384 MPs. The increased capacity of the chambers has been provisioned for keeping in mind future increase in the number of MPs. Currently, the Lok Sabha has 545 MPs and the Rajya Sabha 245. All MPs will have separate offices in the new building.

The new Parliament building will have a grand Constitution Hall showcasing India's democratic heritage. The Constitution Hall will showcase the original copy of the Constitution and a visitors' gallery digitally displaying India's democratic heritage.

The existing Parliament House building will continue to be in use by retro-fitting it to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events.

The new Parliament building will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating 'paperless offices'.

A monitoring committee drawing members from the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the CPWD, the NDMC and architect/designer of the project will monitor the construction work.

The new Parliament building complex is expected to be complete by 2022. The Central Vista project has a work completion deadline of 2024, when the next Lok Sabha election will take place.

When was the existing Parliament building constructed?

The existing Parliament building was constructed by the British colonial rulers. It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. They had, in fact, designed the entire planned construction area of New Delhi. This is why the New Delhi area is often called the Lutyens' zone.

The existing Parliament building complex took six years in construction - from foundation stone laying on February 12 in 1921 to the inauguration by then Viceroy Lord Irwin on January 18 in 1927. The construction cost back then was Rs 83 lakh - a princely sum in those days. The current Central Vista project is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.

In a series of pictures of the avenue, the renovated area appears wider, cleaner, greener and with lots of useful upgrades. Let's have a look at the before and after pictures.

Central Vista Avenue runs from the Rashtrapati Bhawan to the India Gate. It is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi. The Avenue is used for the Republic Day parade and various other ceremonial functions which showcase the nation's capital to the world.

On Saturday, finishing touches were given to the 1.8km redeveloped lawns and new facilities that have been built as part of the Rs 608 crore project, work on which started on February 1 last year.

The lawns on both sides of the canals, which have been repaired, have been connected with bridges, providing people additional green space. Furthermore, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the nodal agency for the project, has constructed four pedestrian underpasses to provide smooth connectivity between the lawns.

There are more than 133 light poles, 4,087 trees, 114 modern signage and stepped gardens along the red granite walkways. According to an official document, there are more than 900 light poles, including those in the gardens and along the Rajpath between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate.

The project strives to preserve the historical significance of the structures and spaces while restoring the original symmetry and order.

By Aneesha Mathur: The Supreme Court is set to pass a verdict today on a set of petitions challenging the central government's decision to demolish and reconstruct the Indian Parliament and Central vista- Rajpath. A three-judge bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sajeev Khanna is set to pronounce the verdict at 10.30 am Tuesday.

A total of five petitions had challenged various aspects of the project. These include the land-use change notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (c) in 2019, the lack of public hearings before permitting a change in use and environmental concerns.

During the hearings, multiple grounds had been argued-- lack of environmental clearances, change in land use without due process, damage to cultural heritage, and the validity of a requirement to demolish existing buildings.

The Centre, on the other hand, argued that the Parliament building as well as several other government offices in the area were overcrowded and could not support requirements. In addition, the central government's counsel also argued that the existing Parliament building was old and did not conform to fire safety norms.

It was also said that the Parliament building's electrical and AC systems were outdated and unsafe while other government buildings did not have enough capacity to house the staff and equipment. The Centre had stated that all due processes were followed and the argument of damage to cultural heritage could not be used to stop necessary work.

The bench had reserved its verdict on November 5.

While the apex court never issued a stay on the project, the bench recently asked the government to ""respect constitutional propriety"" and ensure that no work of demolition, construction, or removal of trees is conducted while the judgment is reserved. This order was passed in the wake of media reports indicating that demolition work had already begun at the Parliament building.

By Aneesha Mathur: Delhi High Court has junked a petition that sought stay on the Central Vista project and said it is an essential project and of national importance.

The Delhi High Court bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh has also fined the petitioners Rs 1 lakh and said the petition is not bona fide. The court has said since the construction workers are residing on-site, there is no question of staying the Central Vista construction work.

Delhi HC has said the petition has been filed to stop the Central Vista project, which is a vital public project and cannot be seen in isolation.

'It's an essential project of national importance. It is vitally important' said the Delhi HC while upholding the legality of the Central Vista project. The government has to complete the work of Central Vista by November 2021.

Delhi High Court also observed, 'Since the workers are staying at the site and all Covid protocols are being adhered to, there is no reason for this court while exercising powers under Article 226 to stay the project.'

The high court said that it is a motivated petition while penalising the petitioners to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh.

The petitioners had contended in their plea that the Central Vista project was not an essential activity and can be put on hold for time being. During the May 17 hearing, the Centre had termed the plea as a ""facade"" or a ""disguise"", aimed at stalling the project.

The petitioners on the other hand had contended they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area.

The petitioners' counsel had likened the project to ""Auschwitz"", a German concentration camp during World War II.

Hard-hitting arguments against the maintainability of the plea were made during the hearing.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, which has been awarded the tender for the project, had also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workforce.

By Press Trust of India: The CPWD has decided to transplant 1,838 trees from the campus of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), which is proposed to be demolished for the construction of three new office buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The Central Public Works Department has invited bids according to which the agency concerned will have to transplant trees in 60 days and 365 days will be for the maintenance of the transplanted trees.

The CPWD said the entire project will be executed at an estimated cost of around Rs 1.86 crore.

Last month, the CPWD had invited bids for three new office buildings under the Common Central Secretariat along Rajpath at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore and Rs 139 crore was set aside for five year's maintenance.

These three new buildings will come on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located.

There are 1,150 trees having girth up to 50 cm, which will be transplanted, the bids stated, adding that there are also 401 trees which have girth beyond 50 cm and up to 90 cm.

In bid documents, the CPWD said it is proposed to avoid cutting of trees to the maximum extent and instead transplant the affected trees, within the site or in the vicinity, in a phased manner.

The girth and height of the tree will be measured and recorded before the start of any activity, the CPWD said, adding that photographs of each tree before the start of the process of translocation will be submitted by the bidder. The tree will be geo-tagged before and after transplantation.

""Lifting of trees shall be carried out or supervised by a qualified and/or suitably experienced person and crane operator using a crane and supports. It shall be ensured that there is no damage to the soil ball or any scratching and splitting of the root system. The tree should be kept intact without injuries to its root system, trunk and crown,"" it stated.

The entire process of translocation will be video graphed and submitted fortnightly to the CPWD. Penalty of Rs 5,000 will be imposed if the agency fails to do so.

The agency will carry out a social audit and get certified ""survival assessment report"" at the end of each maintenance sub-period (quarterly) to ascertain survival rate.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3 km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new prime minister''s residence and prime minister''s office, and a new vice president enclave.

By India Today Web Desk: The Modi government's Central Vista got the green flag from the Delhi High Court that imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted a stay on the ambitious but contentious project.

For the Central Vista project, no heritage building will go, Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said in an interview with India Today TV Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai. Excerpts:

Q: Why have you and your government used the word essential service for this grand project?

These are technical terms. The High Court has not used the word as far as I remember. I'm yet to go through the full judgment. They have said it's a project of national importance. They said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority does not provide for stoppage of work.

They said that they have been told necessary arrangements have been made for those working at the site. For the Parliament building, 1,300 people are working. And of them, 900 have been vaccinated. So, let's separate the two. All this had been cleared by the Supreme Court. We have taken all permissions. We have followed due process. In spite of that, they went to stop the project.

Q: You're not answering my question. Why did the government call this project an essential service?

We started the work with all due clearances prior to the second wave. If you stop the work, here or at any other construction project, you're going to lay off the workers.

So, you're compounding the problem. In a pandemic, when you need economic activities, if you're able to create a bubble... Anyway, the High Court has given the go-ahead...

Q: But when the state is struggling to provide its citizens with oxygen, ventilators and hospital beds, here is a grand project that's going on... How do you respond to those who call this a vanity project for Prime Minister Modi?

Central vista is the name of the overall project, which includes 10 government buildings where 51 departments and ministries will be housed. It will have a central conference facility; it will have Indira Gandhi National Centre for Performing Arts on a global scale; it will be museums shifting here, the Prime Minister's house, for any prime minister, and the Vice-President's house.

First point: no heritage building is being brought down. This Parliament building demand came during the Congress time in 2012. If we were to postpone it any further, many of us would have been guilty of criminal neglect. The building is completely hollow inside. It's not safe for inhabitation. When we celebrate the 75th anniversary next year, we need a new building. It's time-bound because of the 26th January parade. Whose vanity? They're calling it Modi Mahal.

advertisement

Everything may not be more than Rs 14,000 crore. Why are we picking on this? We need a new Parliament. Vaccination? There is no binary between the two. Rs 35,000 crore was set aside for vaccines. If you need more money for vaccines, it will be provided. We have already met the oxygen demand. This is a perception narrative being falsified by the Congress. Let's have a serious discussion.

Q: It's one thing to do the facelift of Parliament building, but you seem to be doing a grand reconstruction... Is that all required?

Even in 2012, you asked for a new Parliament building. Not a single heritage building will be demolished.

In the letter, Opposition leaders urged PM Modi to procure vaccines centrally from all available sources - global and domestic - and spend a budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for the same. They also requested him to provide Rs 6,000 per month as financial aid to the unemployed.

By Aneesha Mathur: The Delhi Waqf Board has approached the high court for protection and preservation of six religious properties situated in and around the places where the work under the Central Vista redevelopment project is taking place.

The six properties include five mosques that are more than 100 years old, the petition said. Masjid Zabta Ganj, Jama Masjid New Delhi, Masjid Sunehri Bagh, Mazar Sunehri Bagh, Masjid Krishi Bhawan and Masjid Vice President House are the properties which the Delhi Waqf Board has demanded protection for.

""The waqf properties subject matter of the present petition, being places of worship, have great sentimental value and it is necessary for the respondent to clear the doubts with respect to the future of these waqf properties,"" the Waqf Board said.

The matter, which came up for hearing in Delhi High Court on Tuesday, was adjourned till September 29 after the solicitor general sought time to seek instructions.

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that it was not possible to issue a stay on the Central Vista project as the Supreme Court had already denied a stay in different petitions.

""There are timelines, a plan for construction. I am sure there will be some...they would have taken this into account. It is not something that has suddenly cropped up. It is an old structure. They would have catered to it,"" observed the bench.

WHAT IS THE CENTRAL VISTA PROJECT?

The Central Vista redevelopment project is a construction plan to give India's power corridor a new spatial identity in what is usually called Lutyen's Delhi.

The existing buildings for Parliament, various offices of the central government, the residence of the prime minister and also the vice-president's house, in the view of the government, have been found to be inadequate.

New buildings will be constructed along the Rashtrapati Bhavan-India Gate stretch of the Rajpath in New Delhi.

The new Parliament Building Complex, triangular in shape spread over 64,500 square metre, is described as the pivot of the Central Vista project design. It is to be much bigger than the existing Parliament building and will be able to house 1,224 Members of Parliament.

According to the Central Vista redevelopment plan, North and South Blocks will be converted into museums. However, the current residence of the vice president is among the buildings identified for demolition.

People witnessing the Republic Day parade this year will get to see major changes along the stretch in terms of the new look of Rajpath and facilities created under the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who visited Central Vista Avenue, said that a full dress rehearsal parade will be held on Sunday.

""In spite of (recent) rains, etc., all the work is complete,"" Puri told reporters, adding that only 25 trees have been relocated and of them, 22 trees have been shifted to another location and three are here.

By Press Trust of India: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday hit back at the Congress for attacking the government over its Central Vista redevelopment project, saying the party's discourse is ""bizarre"" as its leaders themselves had supported the idea when the UPA was in power.

The accusation comes hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the Narendra Modi government for executing the project, terming it a ""criminal wastage"" while asking the dispensation to focus on people's lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.

'Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. The cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India's healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities,"" Puri tweeted.

In a series of tweets, the Union housing and urban affairs minister, whose ministry is executing the government's ambitious project, said the Central Vista is not a new project and alleged that during the UPA government, Congress leaders had written about the need for a new parliament.

""Congress doesn't stop at hypocrisy. Look at their shameful double face. During UPA, Congress leaders wrote about the need for a new parliament. The Speaker in 2012 wrote a letter to Urban Development Ministry for the same. And now they have the gall to oppose the same project?,' he said.

""They want to distract people from monumental governance failures in their states by spreading lies. So they indulge in cheap politics despite knowing this project creates direct & indirect employment for thousands of skilled, semi-skilled & unskilled workers in these times,"" he alleged in another tweet.

Puri also accused the Congress and its allies of splurging on reconstructing an MLA hostel in Maharashtra and building a new Legislative Assembly building in Chhattisgarh, adding that ""If this is fine, what is the problem with Central Vista?.""

Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged in a tweet: ""Central Vista is criminal wastage. Put people's lives at the centre- not your blind arrogance to get a new house!.""

Puri said there are hundreds of projects being executed by various departments and added that governance has not come to a standstill, unlike Congress's times of policy paralysis.

""... Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It's only the Congress that's obsessed about it, nobody else.' Puri said.

Besides the new Parliament building, the redevelopment of the Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's Residence and Prime Minister's Office, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

In another tweet, Puri said only projects for the new Parliament building and rejuvenation of Central Vista Avenue have been awarded at an estimated cost of Rs 862 crore and Rs 477 crore respectively till now.

He also said there are many components in the Central Vista project which are spread over several years.

The top court was hearing a plea against the Delhi High Court order which said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project of the central government.

""Any change at the ground level will be at their own risk,"" said a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar.

The vehement plea of the petitioner that the ground situation at the site should not be changed as there are several monuments of national heritage which may be removed, did not cut much ice with the court which observed that the project will not be completed within a week.

The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, was informed by the petitioner that two notifications have been issued one regarding land use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

""We have already said, whatever step are taken, it is on their risk,"" the bench observed.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on July 7, allowed the petitioner to amend his plea to challenge the recent decisions taken by the authority for the project.

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, argued that till the next date of hearing no clearance should be granted as all those clearances will also be challenged.

The bench asked the petitioner to file his compilation by June 23 and directed the Centre to file its response by July 3.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The two petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

By India Today Web Desk: The Central Vista project to redevelop Delhi's Rajpath is a dream project for PM Narendra Modi, Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said while speaking at Agenda AajTak 2019.

When asked about the thinking of the government behind the redevelopment of Central Vista and areas near Rajpath, Puri said that the project is not a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) project and but that of the government.

advertisement

He said, ""Central Vista project is not a BJP project but the government's project. It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's old dream.""

""For the project, we conducted a design competition and there were 27 applicants. This was a global tender. Indian architects, design companies, international companies, urban planners and many more participated in the competition. A total of six were shortlisted,"" said Hardeep Singh Puri.

Talking about the current design of the Vista project, the minister said, ""The current design does not include dismantling traditional heritage infrastructure such as Rashtrapati Bhawan, North Block, South Block, and Parliament building. However, their usage can be changed.""

""There are reasons for this. The buildings have been constructed between 1911 and 1927. These buildings are not efficient buildings and they pose a problem for seismic challenges. We are spending Rs 1,000 crore every year from the government fund to get accommodation spaces for government offices. Space is there but its utilization is sub-optimal and we need to resolve that.""

Puri also talked about unauthorised colonies and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). He said his ministry has sanctioned over 9 million homes under the scheme till November and will sanction another crore by March 2020. Out of the 9.7 million homes that have been sanctioned, foundations have been laid for about seven lakh homes, Puri said.

By Mausami Singh: The Congress leadership on Monday slammed the Centre over its vaccine policy. Expressing deep concern, senior Congress leader KC Venugopal said that the Narendra Modi-led central government's vaccine policy was flawed as crores of people who did not have access to the internet were being left out of the immunisation drive.

Addressing a press conference after the Congress Working Committee meet in New Delhi, Venugopal said that the committee passed two resolutions during the meeting - one on the Centre's vaccine policy and second to postpone the elections for the post of party president till the Covid situation is resolved.

""Vaccine supplies are grossly insufficient yet the government denies the hard facts. The pricing policy is opaque and discriminatory, and contrary to economic and all other logics,"" Venugopal said.

""The government has passed on the financial responsibility of vaccinating people in 18-45 age group to states that are already facing several financial stress. Mandatory online registration without walk-in option will exclude and have excluded millions of our people,"" he said.

HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, based in Ahmedabad, is led by architect Bimal Patel and has developed several projects, including the Sabarmati Riverfront Development where Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a mammoth event to celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.

It has also developed the Central Vista at Gandhinagar and the Mumbai Port Complex.

On the cost of the project, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said usually, the consultation fee is around three per cent of the total project cost.

However, sources in the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) said the project cost may increase due to different aspects.

The development or redevelopment of Parliament will be done by August 2022 when India celebrates its 75th Independence Day. By next year, the Central Vista will be redeveloped and the common Central Secretariat will be built by 2024, as per plan.

Puri, who was accompanied by ministry Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra and CPWD Director General Prabhakar Singh, said a total of six bids were received, and HCP Design's selection was made by a six-member jury led by Director of the School of Planning and Architecture P S N Rao.

The minister, however, made it clear that the facade of the 90-year-old Parliament building, and North and South blocks, which are heritage buildings, will not be touched while redeveloping the Central Vista, an over three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

To facilitate the new Common Central Secretariat, several buildings such as the Shastri Bhawan, the Nirman Bhawan, the Krishi Bhawan and the Udyog Bhawan may be razed. The government has not taken a decision on it yet.

""It's a very a major project which will be executed on mission-mode... the time has now come to build modern, world-class, energy-efficient buildings which will be defining the characteristic of Delhi as a leading world capital for the next 200 years,"" Puri told reporters.

He said that the revamp project will used the best technology to make Delhi a world-class city.

The minister said the government will go through public consultations till the tendering process for selecting a contractor is complete.

It will also engage various stakeholders such as heritage experts, urban and traffic specialists while executing the ambitious project of the Modi government, Puri said.

""At present, our government offices are strewn all over Delhi... We want all essential government offices at one place,"" Puri said, adding that the new buildings will be energy efficient and modern work places.

Besides HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd, five other firms -- CP Kukreja Architects, Sikka Associates Architects, INI Design Studio, Arcop Associates Pvt Ltd and Architect Haffez Contractor -- participated in the bidding process.

The ministry secretary said on Monday, he will call a meeting with those architecture firms which could not win consultancy bid and will get suggestions from them.

On his part, CPWD Director General Prabhakar Singh said while choosing the architecture firm, 80 per cent weightage was given to quality aspect and 20 per cent to financial aspects.

The buildings on Raisina Hills were constructed from 1911 to 1931 and designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, he said, adding that at that time, all these were designed to have offices for the viceroy and the secretariat.

The Parliament building was constructed in the same period. Various building along Rajpath have been constructed at different stages for accommodating offices of various central government ministries and departments, Singh said.

About the redevelopment plan of the Central Vista, Puri had in September said buildings that had been built in the 1960s and the 1970s should have been torn down many years ago.""Something went wrong there,"" he had said.

Using cricket terms to take a dig at earlier governments, he had said, ""Either we (CPWD under previous governments) lowered the standard or we took eyes off the ball.""

""We wanted to spin the ball but something else happened and in the process it was a hit-wicket,"" the minister had said.

The construction work of a new parliament building and the revamp of Rajpath are underway as part of the Central Vista redevelopment work.

On April 19, the Delhi Police had given its nod for the movement of vehicles ferrying workers engaged in the project during lockdown following the request of CPWD --- the executing agency of the ambitious plan.

""We have given permission to the request of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The permission has been granted for the onsite work. No movement from the outside is permissible,"" a senior police officer told PTI.

According to DDMA's order, construction work has been allowed at those construction sites where workers have been given on-site accommodation.

An official at the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) said: ""We are continuing the work to the extent possible with the labour available at site.""

TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O'Brien took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah over the project.

""Why are we in the Opposition criticising the Central Vista project? It is a very, very important project! Modi must have a peacock garden built next to his new office and Shah must have a verandah next to his office for his three pet poodles (also known as the EC).

""This is why the central Vista project is needed. We, the silly opposition, want the Rs 20,000 crores being spent for central Vista to be used instead to vaccinate 80 per cent of the people of India. Priorities?"" O'Brien told PTI.

Delhi logged a record 381 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, while the positivity rate stood at 32.72%.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also slammed the government for continuing with the construction work even during lockdown.

By Aneesha Mathur: The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition seeking a stay on the construction work underway for the Central Vista project in New Delhi as the matter is pending with the Delhi High Court.

The petitioner had sought suspension of all kinds of construction activity in relation to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project in compliance of the orders issued by DDMA in the wake of the Covid-19 surge in Delhi.

While the DDMA order had stayed all construction work in the national capital, the work on the Central Vista project was allowed after special permission. The work on the project has been categorised as 'essential'.

""How can construction be an essential activity? In a health emergency, we cannot risk the lives of workers and their families and put more pressure on the healthcare system,"" Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioner, told the apex court.

Luthra argued that Delhi was suffering from a broken health system and, at such a time, people working on the Central Vista project were being asked to step out of their homes. ""I am told workers are coming from Kirti Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan,"" the advocate said.

Luthra mentioned that while construction work was currently underway at eight different sites, the petition pertained to construction underway at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and the gardens.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected to the petition, terming it adversarial, as the matter was pending in the Delhi High Court.

The petitioner had filed the same plea in the HC, which kept the next hearing on May 17. However, Luthra pointed out that the matter was of urgent concern as the expert expected the Covid-19 pandemic to peak in mid-May.

The SC bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari dismissed the petition saying that the HC was seized of the matter. However, the bench added, that the petitioner can approach the HC and request an urgent hearing on Monday.

""We are of opinion that since the matter is pending before HC and the order challenged in this SLP [special leave petition] is only an adjournment, we would not be inclined to enter into the merits of the case. In given circumstances, we request Mr Luthra to file it himself or through any other counsel, to make a request before the chief justice of HC on Monday to take up the matter as early as possible,"" the bench said.

""We hope and trust that the high court shall consider the prayer for an early hearing,"" it said.

The Centre's redevelopment project in the Central Vista area of Lutyens Delhi envisages a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had, on January 5, given its green signal to the project, rejecting a batch of petitions challenging the scheme for alleged violation of land use and environmental norms.

By Aneesha Mathur: The Delhi High Court on Monday reserved its order on a plea seeking a stay on the construction of Central Vista in New Delhi amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

During the hearing, senior advocate Siddarth Luthra - representing the petitioner - argued that the Centre was targeting petitioners for raising the issue of their own health.

Luthra said that the plea was moved with a concern for the health and safety of construction workers on the project site. He accused the Centre of attacking the petitioners.

advertisement

""They [the Centre] claim the petitioners are raising a challenge to the Central Vista project. Even when they accept that we have raised a limited challenge, they choose to attack the messenger. Forgetting that the message is about right to health, life and safety. Our plea clearly states that we are not seeking to overreach the SC order allowing for the Central vista project,"" Luthra said.

""We have said we are concerned about ongoing construction activity - relentless, unmindful and reckless act - that poses threat to life of workforce. The site has potential to be a superspreader. This matter could have been easily looked into. Citizens expect openness and honesty. Instead, we have been shouted down. They are attacking us,"" Luthra said.

Luthra also noted that the authorities have banned photography and videography of the Central Vista construction sites.

""Though they have asked us to go visit the site, the Central Vista is now a central fortress. No one is allowed to go inside. Notices have been put up of ""no photography, no video. Only staff allowed inside"","" he noted.

In his arguments, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta slammed senior advocate Luthra for his emotive please during a factual hearing. Mehta said that the petition was selective as it only targeted one construction project while several others were underway in Dlehi simultaneously.

Mehta told the court that the constriction work has not been prohibited in Delhi completely. He said that the construction work was also underway for the central armed forces hospital, Pragati Maidan project, DMRC projects, Narela Housing project and IIC Dwarka.

""This is a selective public interest litigation. They don't care about other workmen,"" Tushar Mehta said.

After the solicitor general termed the PIL as ""motivated"", senior advocate Maninder Singh for Shapoorji Pallonji Group also termed the petition misleading.

Maninder Singh argued that the petitioners were trying to sensationalise the issue.

Singh also argued that delaying or suspending work at the Central Vista site would be a security threat.

""Half of Rajpath is dug up. If the project is left unfinished during monsoon there will be waterlogging. Nearby areas will sink if the water is allowed to fill up. The Republic day celebration cannot be shifted. There is always a security threat during the Republic Day celebration,"" Singh said.

The Central Vista project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan. The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.

The plea pertains to the construction on a 3.5 kilometre stretch of Rajpath.

There was no prior intimation or security detail regarding his visit.

PM Modi made an unannounced visit to the construction site of the new Parliament building.

On December 10, 2020, PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building in Delhi, at an event that was attended by leaders from various political parties, Cabinet ministers and ambassadors of different countries.

The new building, which will have an area of 64,500 square metres, is expected to be completed by 2022. The December 2022 session will be held under the new roof, as per plans.

The estimated cost of construction of the Parliament building is Rs 971 crore. This includes everything from construction to safety equipment and all other features.



The new Lok Sabha will have seating space for 888 MPs, and the Rajya Sabha, for 384 MPs. There will be space for additional seating (to be brought in) as wellthe new Parliament building will be able to accommodate 1,382 people in the Lok Sabha. MPs will be able to sit there during the President's address or during joint sessions of Parliament.



In an interview with India Today, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said, the foundation stone of the existing Parliament building was laid in 1921, and it was constructed in 1927the building is almost 100 years old. The interior of the existing building has changed a lot, and the demand for a new Parliament building is quite old. Several states have constructed new Assembly houses in the past decades, but the Parliament still operates out of a British-era building.

Birla further stated that MPs have been raising demands for a new Parliament house since India's 60th Independence day. ""When Mira Kumar was the speaker of the Lok Sabha, there was even a discussion on constructing a new Parliament building. For these reasons, as well as with a view to security, it is necessary to provide a convenient platform to the MPs who work here,"" he said.

By India Today Web Desk: Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said the new Parliament building, being constructed as part of the Central Vista project, would be ready for the 2022 Winter session.

Speaking at the 19th edition of the India Today Conclave 2021, Hardeep Singh Puri said the need for modern Independent India to have a governance architecture with sufficient space was imperative.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the project in December 2020. The new Parliament building will have an area of 64,500 square metres.

""A narrative has come up around Central Vista, some imaginary, some fanciful. The set of buildings that we now refer to as Central Vista were conceptualised sometime around 1910. The building now was never designed to be Parliament. It was designed to be a council house of a colonial power,"" said Hardeep Singh Puri.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new Prime Minister's residence and office, and a new Vice President's Enclave.

The old Parliament building was conceived in 1913. Construction started on February 12, 1921, and on January 18, 1927, the Viceroy of India, Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, commonly known as Lord Irwin, dedicated the building as the Imperial Legislative Council.

Hardeep Singh Puri said the magnitude of the Central Vista project was mammoth and the timelines too tight. The Union Minister also said the current Parliament building was ""unsafe"".

""The current Parliament building does not have the capacity to accommodate all the members. The number of members has been increasing since Independence. Internal adjustments had to be made, like five people sitting in space for two. It is an unsafe building as Delhi lies in seismic zone IV. The building has been designed as per the parameters of seismic zone V,"" Hardeep Singh Puri said.

Bimal Patel, chief architect of the project, said the Parliament building had complex requirements. ""We have to create facilities where an expanded house can sit. The key and most important thing is to make a building that functions well,"" said Bimal Patel, who is also the president of CEPT University.

Patel's firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management had bagged the contract for designing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious project in 2019.

The Central Vista project has also come in for criticism from the Opposition, which has called it a ""vanity project"" and ""an example of misplaced priorities of the government in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic"".

Calling the criticism part of a false narrative and politically motivated, Hardeep Singh Puri said, ""These are shoot-and-scoot artists. During the pandemic, we had several ongoing projects. Why did the activists pick up the Central Vista project and move court? The Delhi High Court has imposed a punitive fine on them. We also completed the Defence office buildings within 13 months instead of 24 months.""

The Central Vista has got a green flag from the Delhi High Court, which imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted a stay on the ambitious project.

Bimal Patel said Parliament's new building would have a triangular shape to reflect the importance of triangles being a sacred geometry in various religions. ""This will be a building with most modern facilities but displaying our culture and tradition as well,"" Bimal Patel said.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also attacked the Union government last month over the central vista redevelopment project, terming it a ""criminal wastage"". He had asked the dispensation to focus on people's lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.

By India Today Web Desk: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his surprise visit to the construction site of the new Parliament in New Delhi.

Taking to Twitter, he said that PM Modi had violated the principle of separation of powers, which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

As per the Supreme Court judgment, Parliament is the basic structure of the Constitution and the theory of separation of powers says the executive can't interfere in the activities of the judiciary or legislature, said Owaisi.

972,https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/how-artisans-from-kashmir-will-add-to-grandeur-of-indias-new-parliament-2286912-2022-10-18,"In a tiny, scarcely furnished room in Shunglipora village in Kashmir's Budgam, 25-year-old Sara Khan, mother of three, has been working assiduously on a wooden loom. She has a splitting headache and her hands are marked with cuts. While the former is caused by the long, unending hours of work, the cuts are courtesy the fine silk yarn she makes carpets with. But Sara carries on. 'The dense animal designs are challenging and give me a headache. I have never woven such an intricate piece.'

Sara, who learnt carpet weaving in early childhood, is one of the 50 skilled artisans from Budgam selected to make 12 carpets for Central Vista, the under-construction Parliament building in New Delhi. The carpets, each 87-square-feet big, would cover an area of about 1,050 square feet. The building will be adorned with traditional items from other states as well to showcase India's rich heritage.

advertisement

'I keep my eyes on the loom like a hunter watches her prey,' says Sara, who is making a 'Shikaar' design for the first time. Her three family members - an 18-month-old toddler, two young kids aged six and four years, and her husband, who is also a weaver - sit in the same room as she goes about weaving. Carpet weaving is the family's only source of income, though they divide time between weaving and farming in the summer.

Like Khans, the other artisans, too, are proud that their carpets will be laid out in the Parliament building. In addition, not alone are the wages for this project (Rs 4,000 per ft) much higher than the meagre Rs 150-220 a day they usually earn, but the project has also rekindled their confidence in the dying craft. Many are currently in debt. For example, Abdul Rahim Khan and his brother in Budgam are unable to pay Rs 2,000 every month for the Rs 90,000 loan they took from a bank. Of the around 80,000 artisans in Kashmir registered with the J&K handicrafts department and the handlooms department, many have abandoned the carpet-making craft or have taken it up as part-time work due to meagre wages.

The Central Vista opportunity was a big surprise for Kashmir's small-time weavers. In October last year, a Kashmiri carpet firm was approached by a Delhi-based company to design samples. Qamar Tahiri, promoter of Tahiri Carpets, couldn't believe it when he was told that his samples were selected for the Parliament building. 'We did not know the firm, but a person we know approached us about making carpet samples. The samples were approved and we were told that the carpets are meant for the Parliament building,' says Tahiri, 29. 'The 50 artisans were selected from among 400 weavers based on skill and experience. The work started in December 2021, and the carpets will be dispatched this month,' says Qamar Tahiri. The raw material for the carpets, including soft silk yarn with natural dye, was sent by the Delhi firm.

It's believed that Kashmiri carpets became popular in the 15th century, when Sultan Zainul Abidin, popularly known as Budhshah, brought artisans from Persia and Central Asia to train people and set up facilities locally. The industry thrived for a long time and constituted a major share of the state's exports. But the last 10 years have been rough. According to data provided by the Jammu and Kashmir's government's Handlooms & Handicrafts department, the industry saw a massive downfall in annual exports, from over Rs 567 crore a decade ago to Rs 299 crore in 2021. The production, too, has fallen from Rs 715 crore to almost half in the same period.

advertisement

Kashmir handicrafts businessman Aejaz Sheikh, who runs SA Associates, attributes the decline to multiple factors, including an influx of machine-made carpets from countries like Iran and Turkey, the high prices of handmade Kashmir carpets, and a lack of design choices. Unlike Iran, which has introduced facilities for the manufacturing of carpets, the Indian government has been slow to support Kashmir's carpet industry. For instance, weavers in Kashmir, who follow traditional methods, do not use more than 17 colours, and the designs are centuries old.

Over the years, Kashmir's carpet weavers have mastered traditional heritage designs such as 'Kaashan', 'Hamadam', etc. But now, seeing the decline in trade, the Jammu & Kashmir government, on the directions of the central government, has prepared a detailed project report for setting up a model carpet village in Bandipora's Sumbal-Sonawari-Hajin, where 10,000 weavers are engaged in full-time work, in addition to working the field. The project will facilitate modern designing, dyeing, washing and finishingall under one roofbesides providing the weavers with raw material, modern steel looms and direct market linkages on 100 kanals.

advertisement

J&K director of Handloom & Handicrafts, Mehmood Shah, says they are waiting for the textile ministry's nod for the project now. 'The J&K government is working for the welfare of artisans and has introduced education schemes for their children. Apart from this, the limit for artisans under the Credit Card scheme has been doubled to Rs 2 lakh, with an interest rate of 7 per cent ,' says Shah, who last year managed to get Srinagar into the prestigious list of UNESCO creative cities network for 2021 for craft and folk art. But more needs to be done, he says, adding that they will be participating in international and national exhibitions to promote Kashmiri arts.

Back in Shunglipora, Sara doesn't seem very enthused by these announcements and is more concernedlike hundreds of other carpet weaversabout getting decent wages. 'If we get more orders like these, we will be able to clear the bank credit within no time,' she says. 'But that's like hoping for a miracle. Manufacturers neither pay us in time nor do they pay us enough to compensate us for our hard labour.' For now, however, she is focused on her 'Shikaar' piece. 'Even a small mistake can change everything.'

Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India has taken another step in developing the nation's capital according to the needs and aspirations of a new India in the 75th year of India's Independence.

The prime minister asserted that for a very long time, the defence-related work was being conducted from pre-Independence era hutments which were made keeping in mind horse stable and barracks needs.

The two buildings, constructed by the Housing and Urban Affairs with resources allocated by the Defence Ministry, have an office space of 9.60 lakh sq feet.

""These new defence office complexes are going to further strengthen our efforts to make the working of our forces more convenient and effective,"" he said.

He said the modern offices will go a long way in effectively carrying out all the work related to the security of the nation by the three forces.

He appreciated the inclusion of attractive artefacts by Indian artists in the complexes as symbols of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'.

'The complexes reflect the modern form of diversity of our culture while preserving the vitality of Delhi and environment."" PM Modi said.

He also stressed the role of modern infrastructure in the government's focus on ease of living and ease of doing business.

""Today, when we are focusing on ease of living and ease of doing business, modern infrastructure plays an equally important role in this. This is the spirit at the core of the work being done today related to Central Vista,"" the prime minister said.

In his address, PM Modi criticised those who were opposed to the Central Vista project, saying they never bothered to find out how the armed forces personnel were working in those hutments.

""When we talk about the capital, it is not just a city. The capital of any country is a symbol of the thinking, determination, strength and culture of that country,"" PM Modi said.

""India is the mother of democracy. Therefore, the capital of India should be such that its central focus should be people,"" he said.

The two buildings, constructed by the Housing and Urban Affairs with resources allocated by the Defence Ministry, have an office space of 9.60 lakh sq feet.

PM Modi also said that he was confident that work on the new Parliament building will be completed on time.

He added that the work on the defence office complex which was to be completed in 24 months has been completed in a record time of just 12 months despite challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

PM Modi said the defence office complexes are the manifestation of changing work culture and priorities of the government.

The recent announcement by the central government of its plans to redevelop the Parliament complex and Central Vista has stunned built-environment professionals across India. It appears from the published Expression of Interest document that the government has not thought through the project. The timelines defined appear to be impossible, the conditions of work ignore the city altogether and treat it like a bid for a mere engineering project, when, in fact, the implications are far more complex and consequential for Delhi. It also raises questions about the larger issues of the urbanisation process in India.

Delhi has a circular plan and the Central Vista lies exactly in the geographic centre of the body of the city. Unlike most other metropolitan cities, which have the highest density at the core, Delhi has a green, open core. This is indeed a unique condition and the green image contributes to the idea of a 'nation space' for the people of India. Events like the January 26 parade reinforce that image. Within Delhi itself, thousands of citizens consider it the only grand, green lung for their family outings. No tourist in Delhi is likely to leave without a visit to the Central Vista. It is not just a piece of real estate, but the core identity of India's Capital.

advertisement

The Central Vista has been a highly protected special district in the Delhi Master Plan and detailed urban design studies need to be conducted before development guidelines are drawn up. The Parliament building and the buildings on the Raisina Hill are part of a protected precinct. The Central Vista Committee, the Supreme Court formulated Heritage Conservation Committee, the Delhi Urban Art Commission and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation are all watchdogs of the Central Vista. The proposal suggested seems to violate the existing heritage conservation rules for 'grade-A' buildings.

The area is also practically Delhi's green lung. Thousands of full-grown trees stand in this zone and their fate is now anybody's guess. The green avenues of the area have terminal vistas in the spires and domes of the Central Secretariat Complex. The image is a composite of such avenues, building spires, domes and walkways. Even the compound walls and the gates of these buildings are integral to their heritage character. The proposal seems to reduce all these to an unimaginative engineering tender process. Will the Central Vista, one of the most celebrated urban design ensembles in the world, be reduced to a kid brother of glitzy Gurgaon or Noida? Increasing the parking load in the city core is, at best, unwise.

The most important issue that needs rethinking is our stand on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Change Accord. One is proud of the fact that India has been a signatory to both these UN initiatives, but the new Central Vista proposal ignores sustainability and climate change issues with disdain. Our international position is one and our action on ground is another!

Of course, it is laudable that radical change is being embraced for administrative reforms. The fact that the number of MPs has more than doubled since Independence, certainly needs addressing. But 60-80 years is the given life of cement concrete after which it deteriorates. Wishing to create a new legacy for the next 150-200 years with concrete buildings is another unattainable dream.

What would be the challenges if such a humungous and hurried project is unleashed in the centre of Delhi? While the buildings are being demolished and reconstructed, where would the functioning ministries go? What about the resulting enormous construction waste, dust and other toxins? Where will the water for construction come from? How about the public interface, accessibility, security and storage systems of these ministries? An administrative dystopia is what I see; a project manager's nightmare is heaving into view!

Some serious professional consultations and reflections are required on sustainability, climate change and India's composite urban heritage. n

By India Today Web Desk: Foundation stone for a new Parliament building in Delhi will likely be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the first half of December. Construction for the new Parliament building, not far from the old complex, is expected to be completed in 21 months from the commencement of construction work.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi could lay the foundation stone for the new Parliament building on December 10, said news agency PTI quoting sources. However, final confirmation on the date is subject to the Prime Minister's availability.

The new Parliament building will have separate offices for all MPs, equipped with technology interfaces aimed at creating 'paperless offices'. In addition, the new Parliament building will also have a Constitution Hall, a lounge for MPs, multiple committee rooms, dining areas, parking space and a library.

Tata Projects Limited had in September won the bid to construct the new Parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore.

This is part of the Central Public Work Department (CPWD) and central government's Central Vista project which will include a new triangular Parliament building and a common central secretariat apart from a complete revamp of Rajpath, the 3-km-long path between Rashtrapati Bhavan and India Gate.

Designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, foundation stone for the existing Parliament complex was laid on February 12, 1921. Construction of the same was carried out at a cost of Rs 83 lakhs at the time and took six years to complete. The building was inaugurated by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin on January 18, 1927.

Five statues in the Parliament complex, including the iconic 16-feet high statue of Mahatma Gandhi sculpted by Ram Sutar in 1993, will be temporarily relocated. These statues will be reinstalled at prominent places once the construction work of the new Parliament building is complete.

Anyone lucky enough to traverse New Delhi's power corridor, the 3-km 'Central Vista' that runs from Rashtrapati Bhavan, past North and South Blocks and Parliament to India Gate, in 'Corona lockdown' will encounter a dystopian scene of deserted avenues that echo an eerie loop of warnings issuing from unseen tannoys. But just last month, a brace of committee meetings conducted in the ether of digital conferencing took a very concrete step towards altering the landscape of this iconic quarter of the capital.

An expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the environment ministry, and the Central Vista Committee (CVC) chaired by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), by turn issued key approvals for work to begin on the construction of a new, triangular Parliament building, one of the defining features of the Modi government's controversial project to redevelop the area surrounding the national mall. The stated objectives in commissioning this enormous scheme ranged from the need to accommodate the increasing tribe of MPs to improving infrastructure and synergies in government offices and reducing the maintenance and rental costs of buildings that currently house the ever burgeoning bureaucracy. Much before the lockdown, the project had provoked a storm of well-articulated criticism, pointing to the damage such a scheme would cause to the built heritage and environment of the city, and questioning the justification for the enormous costs of construction in expenditure, disruption and pollution. Such criticisms have only intensified since, and several political parties have now questioned the Centre's priorities in committing a massive Rs 20,000 crore to a prestige project in the face of an international crisis with grave financial implications for India. Yet beyond the faceless committees and the irony of extra-parliamentary clearances for a new Parliament, there is clearly a singular, polarising personality driving this project, through peacetime and pandemic.

The PM's Dreams

Seven years ago, the then chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, inaugurated the first wing of his shiny new office. The Rs 150 crore structure, Swarnim Sankul-I, was apparently both vaastu-compliant and modern. A leading business daily described it as 'looking more like a corporate office than a sarkari one', in keeping with the managerial aesthetic Modi had carefully cultivated. 'The CM was very particular about the quality of the building,' said the architect, Bimal Patel.

But Modi's true ambitions were already well known, and even as he settled in, the new premises were regarded as a mere stepping stone, winkingly dubbed 'North Block'. By the time the companion complex of Swarnim Sankul-II was ready in February 2014, the CM was months away from taking his true prize in the real 'South Block', the PMO in New Delhi's imperial-era Central Secretariat.

A little more than five years later, just months into his second tenure as PM, Modi already seems to have outgrown the charms of this colonial-era edifice overlooking the so-called 'Central Vista' of Rajpath. Or for that matter the pleasures of his Lutyens bungalow at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. The broad parameters of the plan to refashion the architecture and spatial geometry of the capital's political and symbolic heart became known last September with the release, or leak, of a series of video 'proposals' and the announcement by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri that the project had been awarded to Bimal Patel, the architect of Modi's corporate-style headquarters in Gandhinagar.

Compared to the competition, the winning proposal from Patel's firm HCP was relatively restrained (Mumbai architect Hafeez Contractor's inadvertently ironic video began with a loop of Modi in full oratorical flight and climaxed with an enormous lotus deathstar impaling the heart of our capital), but there was still enough here to strike terror into anyone concerned for the city's environment, heritage, its public spaces or their democratic symbolism. A phalanx of gigantic Cubist donuts bracketed Rajpath, obliterating well-loved structures such as the Grade-1 listed National Archives and the more recent National Museum and IGNCA. Our historic Parliament was turfed out to pasture as a 'museum of democracy' and pinched into a triangular replica next door. Meanwhile, the PM got a new purpose-built PMO complex opposite the old Parliament on the southern end of Vijay Chowk and a matching residence just above the existing South Block. As if to compound the shock and awe of this architectural campaign, we were informed that the entire project would be completed in time for the next general election in 2024 (the revamp of the Central Vista by 2021, the Parliament by 2022 while the common Central Secretariat [the gigantic donuts] would land by 2024). In one of those perverse ironies of minor detail, the muzak selected as the soundtrack to HCP's video was a loop of tinkling chords from the Latin pop hit Despacito, which, as far too many people already know, means 'slowly'.

A series of enigmatic reassurances from minister Puri that the redevelopment would multiply the green cover 10 times, that 'not a single tree will be cut' and there would be 'widespread public consultation before anything is finalised' did little to quell growing concerns. If anything, Puri's refrain that 'one of the prime minister's dream projects is to reconstruct those buildings built between 1911 and 1927 like North Block, South Block, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament' only stoked fears that an architectural demonetisation by prime ministerial fiat was under way. It didn't help that PM Modi had already given notice of his appetite for grand architectural gestures that set many teeth on edge. While the colossal Patel murti is emblematic of what the critic Alok Rai described as 'the infantile literalism' of the New India where 'size is the only way of creating symbolic intensity', it is the two urban developments widely perceived as Modi's 'dream projects', again ass'�igned to Patel's firm, that have generated the most foreboding: the Sabarmati Riverfront redevelopment in Ahmedabad, commissioned in the early 2000s when Modi was Gujarat CM, and the more recent Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor in the PM's parliamentary constituency Varanasi. As modernising schemes to sanitise and develop ancient and decrepit riverfront neighbourhoods, both these projects have their enthusiasts, of course. They also share a certain heartlessness towards the thousands of subaltern inhabitants evicted in each city.

New Delhi's Nightmare?

Architect and urban planner A.G.K. Menon, who is also convenor of INTACH's New Delhi chapter, asks if 'the Central Vista project is a metaphor for how our politicians imagine the creation of a New India'. While conceding that some redevelopment was required, Menon was puzzled that no heritage or environment impact analysis had been carried out. He is convinced the project is 'motivated by political imperatives' and not the physical or heritage characteristics of this site. 'The extraordinary speed with which it is being implemented is of equal concern,' he says.

Menon and other conservation experts also point to the government's record of privileging 'development' over urban heritage in the capital: the decision in 2015 to scrap the city's bid to be nominated a Unesco World Heritage City, which had been initiated by the previous UPA government; the demolition of Raj Rewal's modernist monument, the 'Hall of Nations' in Pragati Maidan in 2017; and a steady erosion of the independence of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) as a cultural watchdog. Historian Narayani Gupta recalls how in 1989 the DUAC was able to prevent the government of the day from replacing the stone canopy at the eastern end of Rajpath with a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. 'Today,' she says, 'at least three off'�icial organisations and one national NGO are in place to protect heritage buildings, [but when] proposals to destroy with impunity are made by the government, the guardians remain silent in this night-time.'

The opacity of the process, from the 'expression of interest document' to the mysterious 'six-member jury' who evaluated the six proposals, to the 'entry requirements' (the competition was restricted to India-registered firms with an annual turnover of Rs 20 crore and in a position to pony up 'earnest money' of Rs 50 lakh) and the lack of any authentic public consultation fuelled further distrust. By December 2019, even as the anti-CAA protests moved from the national 'commons' of the Boat Club Lawns and India Gate to a new generation of public spaces like Shaheen Bagh and Seelampur, the sharpest opposition to the Central Vista redevelopment was crystallising in the digital agoras of social media.

The architect Narayan Moorthy recalls reaching out to a small group of his colleagues and friends on WhatsApp 'in anguish' over the redevelopment. Within a month, the group had grown into a highly motivated unit of more than 300 urban professionals, architects, designers, RWA members, conservationists, intent on bringing public scrutiny to the issue. Calling themselves 'LokPATH,' this amorphous collective was soon conducting 'tree mappings' of the Central Vista, generating acerbic cartoons for social media mobilisation, and drumming up a petition campaign to 'save Rajpath, save Delhi' by putting the redevelopment plan on hold.

The Talented Mr Patel

To fill the void in the government's outreach, architect Patel himself launched an energetic series of presentations and discussions with the media and architectural forums in February. Speaking to india today [see interview: 'We are turning over a fortress...'], he vigorously defended the virtues of his design while conceding that some elements in the video proposal such as the obliteration of the National Archives or the mothballing of the Parliament building had to change. 'That was never meant to be publicly circulated,' he says, likening the video to a preliminary sketch. Likewise, he acknowledged that the process of public consultation 'could have been done much better'. He made no apologies, however, for the scale and vision of the centrepiece of his design, the parade of rhombuses hedging Raj'�path. 'The intention of building the Central Secretariat is to create office infrastructure that makes government functioning more efficient and productive,' he says, refuting the charge that his buildings are an embodiment of Big Government. He invokes the example of Apple's HQ and contrasts the capital's 'scatter of offices and immense inefficiencies' with some of the modern integrated state secretariats. 'You know how it is in Gandhinagar, everybody is there!' he remembers the PM exclaiming, urging the designers to make space for all ministries in one complex as they had in Gujarat where 'you can sit in one place and run the business of government'.

'Practical, not ideological', 'empirical', 'efficient', 'productive' and 'business of government', Patel's speech is peppered with key words and phrases that must gladden the PM's inner CEO. But for A. Srivathsan, a professor and colleague of Patel's at CEPT University, the problem with the new design is precisely that the 'brief emerges from the government's demand for a more efficient space' rather than a desire for a 'grand public place'. The result, he says, is to 'reinforce a space that signifies colonial dominance and which is suffused with imperial symbols and architecture'. Tellingly, Patel himself, in answering the charge of tampering with urban heritage, insists that he has tried to 'strengthen the original intent' and is doing 'exactly what Lutyens would have done'. Indeed, it's clear that Patel has found inspiration in Lutyens's early sketches depicting a complex of government buildings flanking 'Kingsway' and that his own Combined Central Secretariat is an hommage to the imperial architect's vision of orderliness and authority, turned up to eleven. 'The scale is larger, times have changed,' Patel concedes. 'But hopefully when someone sees it from a distance, they'll say 'it's all the same'.'

The irony of this smooth segue from imperialism to efficiency and back is likely to be lost on the cheerfully businesslike Patel who is candid about his functionalist approach. 'Any project has 10 problems it is solving,' he says. Nine of these are 'simple functional problemsa place to keep this, a place to keep that. One is about identity, what it's going to look like and feel like'. Patel feels the 'identity stuff' has been excessively privileged over the crucial business of solving practical problems.

One is reminded of Lutyens's initial contempt for the 'silly Moghul-Hindu stuff' he felt obliged to incorporate as decorative elements in his designs. His colleague, Herbert Baker, too, was desperate to avoid the 'dreadful Hindoo stuff'. It's hard not to gasp at their lack of self-consciousness at the overwhelmingly European pomp-and-circumstance stuff they bequeathed to us. Similarly, it's ironic and perversely fitting that their successor on Raisina Hill should claim an aversion to the 'identity stuff' and point to the very practical virtues of his design.

Srivathsan acknowledges that Patel has tried to 'strike a difficult balance', and opened up significant public space in the president's estate. Menon offers slightly fainter praise: 'The design proposed by Bimal Patel is reasonably sensitive to the site context.' The political scientist Milan Vaishnav is particularly appreciative of the planned new Parliament building: 'Research shows that Indian MPs represent three times as many citizens as the United States,' he says. 'Given issues with constituency size and regional malapportionment, expanding Parliament's numbers is not out of the realm of possibility.'

Parliamentary capacity is clearly a 'place to keep this, a place to keep that' issue of the kind Patel relishes. But Vaishnav, like many other citizens, also has qualms about it: 'I am torn as to the larger plan. I'm generally conservative on these issues, that is, I believe in integrating the old with the new, rather than wholesale new construction.' Patel would, of course, maintain that he is indeed integrating the old with the new, preserving the listed buildings of colonial provenance and only enhancing Lutyens's vision by obliterating the mish-mash of indifferent post-colonial sarkari architecture below Raisina Hill. However, apart from the usual questions raised against a project of this magnitude, it is surely issues of symbolic affect that may prove the most polarising. The look and feel, 'the identity stuff' as Patel intuited. Indeed, he was already voluble on this point, insisting that his design had reclaimed the 'fortress of governmentbuilt to intimidate Indians', the old hilltop secretariat, and turned it over to the people as a museum space, while also demolishing 'fortresses of culture' like the IGNCA.

But this is clearly not the only possible reading of his designs, or the government's grand design. For senior Congressman Jairam Ramesh, the project represents little more than a narcissistic attempt by PM Modi to leave his monogram on the national fabric. 'At this time of grave financial crisis, it is not just insensitive but obscene to push through a project that will cost upward of Rs 25,000 crore just to satisfy the vanity of one man,' says an incensed Ramesh. 'Reminds me of Hitler wanting Albert Speer to redesign Berlin in the early 1940s.'

Others with a similarly sceptical view will perceive the march of the Combined Central Secretariat, down to the recreational ice cream-and-gubbarawala stretches of the Boat Club lawns, as an advance of new buildings that are bound to intimidate and exclude citizens from a beloved public commons. 'It is likely that these buildings will dwarf even tall trees along the Rajpath, giving it a character more like an urban canyon than a grand processional way,' Martin Lutyens of the Lutyens Trusts (and Sir Edwin's great-nephew) warned in a recent column in this magazine.

The prime minister and his architect may well dismiss such opinions as yet more carping from the 'Lutyens elite'. Patel, for his part, maintains that his ministerial office blocks won't even be visible to a citizen strolling along Rajpath. But in the absence of a genuinely informed and transparent debate to consider, rather than steamroll, the redevelopment of the central vista, Modi's dream will continue to be widely perceived as the architectural expression of an authoritarian streak. And if by 2024, we have emerged from the daymare of a pandemic to find the PM ensconced in the splendid isolation of his new office and residence on the colonial acropolis, we may all ask ourselves whether the dream of a man in the high castle was really our own dream at all.

Alternate Realities: what will happen now?

For the many critics of the central vista redevelopment plan, the government's most recent moves to clear the way for work on a new Parliament in the crepuscular cover of the lockdown is just more evidence of bad faith. Kanchi Kohli of the Centre for Policy Research says this 'plot by plot, building by building approach' has been the government's strategy all along. 'The urgency and opaque manner in which these decisions are taken during a health emergency and national lockdown,' she says, 'give an impression that the central vista project was a fait accompli proposition from the time it was announced.' Similarly, Balbir Verma, a former president of the Indian Institute of Architects and a clearly dissenting member of the CVC, suggests that the committee has been stacked with pliant government officers. 'I am disappointed and concerned that the very purpose of having experts from the national professional bodies on CVC is being defeated. A project like designing a new Parliament building for India, which happens maybe once in a century, is being rushed and not being given its due.'

Even so, the government's plans may yet unravel. Committing such massive funds to a project that serves the comfort of politicians and bureaucrats could still well provoke a significant political backlash in the wake of the ongoing crisis. Meanwhile, petitions challenging land-use changes in the Lutyens zone are pending in the Supreme Court which recently observed (in another central vista-related hearing) that 'during the COVID-19 situation, no one is going to do anything, and there is no urgency'.

Patel for his part maintains that work continues steadily with 'MoHUA, CPWD and all the consultants working online through the lockdown'. Asked about the latest chorus of criticism, including a letter from some 60 senior ex-bureaucrats criticising the redevelopment for profligacy and damage, he responded stiffly, defending it as a 'project aimed at expanding and modernising very important but severely stressed government facilities, enhancing administrative efficiency, reducing recurring operational cost, promoting use of public transit, enhancing sustainability and refurbishing iconic public spaces and cultural amenities'.

On the southeastern bank of the ornamental Boat Club pond of the central vista, a mysterious building site, shrouded in steel sheeting, suggests another twist in the government's strategy. The very same plot is rendered in Patel's visualisations as one of the triangular bookends to the parade of massive sandstone office blocks flanking Rajpath. But a signboard on the shuttering depicts a two-tone sandstone and glass edifice that shares the neo-Lutyens aesthetics of Patel's structures but not their commanding scale. As it turns out, this is VanijyaBhavan, commissioned to house the department of commerce in 2018. The foundation stone was laid in June of that year by PM Modi himself. He had then described the project as a model design, emblematic of his government: smart, green and paperless, and promised it would be complete by 2019-end.

According to an architect from Design Forum International, the Delhi-based firm behind the building, VanijyaBhavan was close to completion before the lockdown halted construction, but is now expected to be ready for inauguration in November this year. The building was designed keeping the tree-line in mind, which is why it is less than 80 feet high (considerably lower than the facades in Patel's plan). 'We are fortunate that our project has the blessings of the same dispensation,' the architect says, explaining the fact that the Rs 226 crore project has not been cancelled despite the government's endorsement of the central vista redevelopment scheme. He speculated that after 'the two structures on Raisina Hill' (the residences of the PM and the vice-president) and Parliament are built, the government may ultimately cut its losses on the rest of Patel's grand plan. It's an outcome that may satisfy no one, but it would be in keeping with an old Delhi tradition of hubris and half-built projects that goes back well beyond Edwin Lutyens.

Those in oppositiona collective of a few hundred architects, urban planners, environmentalists, heritage conservationists, thinkers and citizenshave continued to insist that this proposal be re-examined. The clamour has not abated. There are a fair few things the citizen needs to be made aware of. We do not know if the PM and his Cabinet have been rightly advised. A proposal like this has ramifications, and it must not come into effect without consultative decision making. Regard for processes and institutions is what sets us apart from military dictatorships and monarchies.

(i) Usurpation of land

advertisement

The first issue is the usurpation of land meant for public and recreational uses to bloat government office space. Delhi is one of the few capitals with an open green core fully open to the public. From its very conception by the colonial team of architects, headed by Lutyens and Baker at the turn of the 20th century, this space has been emblematic of the nation of India. Even the colonial imperative recognised that the rulers are nothing without those who are ruled. The grand Kingsway, for instance, was never intended to only be peopled by India's rulers. Queensway intersected it and connected it to Connaught Place. All four corners of the then intended large plaza were reserved for socio-cultural buildings. Only the Archives were built then and the National Museum added later. But this intersection and its erstwhile motive are key to what is wrong with this proposal.

This principle was recognised by our founding fathers. The symbolically renamed Rajpath and Janpath respectively signify the intersection of the government and the people. Various imposing buildings of public celebratory use were planned at this quadrant. In continuation of this, the first Master Plan of 1962 extended the land reserved for socio-cultural uses to a much greater extent than was first planned by the Raj, both towards the West as well as to the complete circle around India Gate occupied by the Princes' palaces. The addition of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) at the third corner in the 1980s was another step that continued this motive. As was the conversion of Jaipur House to the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). Patiala House as a court was already a public building. The later independent conversion of Bikaner house into a place of spirited gatherings is also much in keeping with this.

There is thus a continuum of thought visible from colonial times to the democratic in the imagination of this space. This whole Central Vista space is the citizen's, not the bureaucrats or politicians. The fact that we fully adopted this space after independence, be it for celebration or opposition or sorrow, was fully in keeping with this ethic. This space and all the buildings around embody India's democracy, and if the function of those buildings changes, or if the proportion of buildings devoted to public access change, the very notion of our democracy will be dealt a body blow.

advertisement

While master plans since that first have also stated the desirability of an increase in area devoted to socio-cultural (thus public) uses, as well as to open green/parks, the reality is a gradual insidious erosion in this public space. This happened even under previous governments. Shastri Bhavan and Nirman Bhavan, as they stand today, have at least been partly built upon land demarcated for socio cultural-uses in 1962.The recent Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan (MEA)actually stands squarely on the quadrant at that significant intersection!

This new proposal, however, exceeds them all. It hopes to turn the whole length of Rajpath upto India Gate into an unbroken line of towering eight-storeyed intimidating monoliths of government office blocks that will line both sides of this very public promenade, the gathering space of this nation. It is this aspect we wish to highlight to our fellow citizens. A whole 82 acres of space, hitherto meant for recreational or socio-cultural use, will now change to government offices as per the recent Delhi Development Authority (DDA) notice that we have raised objections to.Opening up already open green space to the public as an artificial arboretum is no compensation for the loss of open recreational space.The new Parliament is being built in one such space.And there is a very real danger of this core open space being closed off to the public for security reasons once it is encircled by all non-public government offices.This is completely contrarian to the conception of this space ever since we colonised it after Independence.

(ii) Danger to our heritage

Currently, only lip service is being paid to the heritage aspects at hand. The original Central Public Works Document (CPWD) Bid document itself blatantly seems to call for tampering with the Grade 1 Parliament building, retaining only its fa�'�ade. The winning scheme video completely removed another Grade 1 heritage buildingthe National Archives, as well as many other Grade 2 ones. That it still was considered for selection and award is stupefying.

To even conceive of ossifying Living Heritage, which was the womb of the dreams and hopes of this nascent nation, into a dusty unused museum or an occasionally used building flies in the face of respect to heritage. Age is not the issue. Buildings are being retrofitted, modernised and repurposed the world over. Developed nations occupy 1000-year-old Parliaments with every mod con retrofitted.

advertisement

Today, while there are assurances that no heritage building will be touched, officials have been talking to the media about new building entrances directly opening off Rajpaththus cutting across the iconic and public lawns, ignoring the fact that the open area of this precinct itself has Grade 1 heritage status!

There is no clarity on which nationally or internationally accepted methodology or charter for treatment of heritage buildings they intend to use. But converting Parliament, North Block and South block into museums will change their use, and there seems to be no recognition that this is contrary to extant Indian law. Also, as more and more details emerge, Metros are planned to be dug under or very near heritage buildings. Our heritage seems to be in grave danger.

(iii) No regard for our environment

Reuse' and repurpose' as desirable motives lie forgotten. Other nations repurpose even the palaces of erstwhile hated dictators into the Parliaments of their New democracy. Here, there seems to be no thought given to the carbon footprint or water needs of this new civil construction. In the name of need for improvement and modernisation, the embedded energy in extant buildings (some recently built by this Nation for hundreds of crores) is set to be discarded and dozens of new monoliths built. In the name of consolidation, 10 separate blocks, connected by an underground metro, are being proposeddepartments that may never have anything to do with each other are going to be brought together. In the name of minimising the disruption caused by the PM's short commute, the centre of Delhi stands to be majorly disrupted for at least four long polluted years. At least 2,000 trees are set to be lost as per very preliminary and partial on-ground mapping.

Rather than decentralising the city and moving offices of lower government functionaries away, the proposal plans to bring in an additional 35,000 personnel into this zone with concomitant increase in junior staff, traffic and civic pressure. This clearly flies in the face of that Minimum Government, Maximum Governance' maxim.

Over the last few weeks, the scope of the initial huge proposal seems to have been reduced successively as opposition has mounted. But, as more and more details emerge, it is visible that the already beleaguered city will grapple with further problems, both in the short and long term.

(iv) An undemocratic lack of transparency

As yet no drawings or details have been properly tabled or exhibited for the common man to satisfy himself with what is exactly intended for her iconic capital space: all we have seen are a few drawings on the backdrops of video interviews. Garbled information is released from time to time by lower and unnamed officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). One would have expected that any proposed modification to such a core urban zone and to such major iconic public buildingswould have been publicly debated for a period before drastic decisions were taken. Leave alone the public, it seems even expertsbe they in heritage conservation, history, the environment or traffic issueshad not been consulted before floating such a mega scheme. There isn't even a mention of one specific name that could help examine the competence of those consulted.

A proposal of this nature is usually informed by prior consultations with many domain experts, possibly lasting a few years, before the brief is even handed to the architects. Even the paucity of information provided to or informed restrictions placed upon the architects in this proposal is stupefying, as is the paucity of information made available to the citizen and expert alike after the announcement of the award and commencement of preparatory work. And this is of grave detriment to the paying public.

(v) The last issue is the process

That the process was all wrong may not immediately interest a layperson. But the truth is that the accepted practice of opening up ideation for every new public building to open public design competitions is a way of ensuring that the citizen (for her taxes paid) gets the best outcome. The selecting jury must necessarily be one of the most eminent professionals available in this country if not the world. Through the actions of bodies like the CPWD or NBCC, we, as a nation, have been distanced from this correct approach to developing or redeveloping public spaces. With a few gaming the system to their own benefit, we have been denied meaningful public infrastructure in every way. This proposal has taken that to epic proportions. It was framed as a Tender as if for contractors. The jury who selected this design remain unknown but the outcome will not only cost the taxpayers ill-affordable thousands of crores, but will have to be lived with forever after.

The expressed motive of not doing what Lutyen did not and reinforcing his imagination is laughable. He was no lover of this civilisation. We need to just accept and internalise our heritage and gently modify it to modern needs, weaving it into our lives. India has already done just that in the decades since 47, in more ways than one. We do not need this rampant disruption. And if we do need some small part of it, that must emerge through national debate and democratic discussion, monitored by a very diverse body of parliamentarians and domain experts.

Experts, activists opposing the project have criticised the approval during the lockdown period. Congress has condemned the decision and demanded the project be suspended due to the coronavirus crisis which has left many jobless.

On April 23, the special advisory group of central vista committee met via video conferencing to discuss the proposal for a new Parliament building. The estimated cost of the project is close to Rs 900 crore.

The meeting was objected to by the independent members on the grounds of lockdown restrictions. But the committee gave no objection to the project on plot no. 118, New Delhi.

The minutes of the meeting recorded that it could not be postponed as the project is important in the national interest and the time scale for implementation of the project cannot be ignored.

The decision to construct a new Parliament building was taken after the architect made an online presentation of the project due to lockdown. The non-government members from the Indian Institute of Architects and Institute of Town Planners were absent during the meeting.

One of the CVC member, Balbir Verma, told India Today TV, ""I am very disappointed and concerned that the very purpose of having experts from the national professional bodies on the Central Vista Committee is being defeated.""

He said that a project like redesigning the Indian Parliament building which happens maybe once in a hundred years is being rushed.

""Such an important meeting to consider the proposed designs was held in the absence of all non-governmental external experts under the guise of urgency ignoring the request for postponement till lockdown restrictions are eased,"" he said.

The member argued: ""What is the point of having experts on the panel when their opinion is not being honoured for such a historic project?""

Lt Col (retired) Anuj Srivastava, an architect, is fighting a legal battle against the government over the Central Vista project.

He told India Today TV that the Expert Appraisal Committee or the Central Vista Committee have been conducting their meetings through video conferencing during the lockdown and have been attempting to clear the Parliament House and Central Vista project.

""We find this deeply disturbing. The very idea of densification of our city-center in these pandemic related times and against the principals of the master plan is highly incorrect, we believe that this entire project requires a rethink,"" he added.

Congress Party has been demanding to scrap of the entire Central Vista Project questioning its need at the time of coronavirus pandemic.

Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the Congress spokesperson, questioned the need for a separate building when there are severe cash crunch and government. He said the government should utilize this money to purchase ventilators and dole cash to jobless migrant laborers stuck in various parts of the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the new look of Delhi's Central Vista in a special event today at 7 pm.

The grand redevelopment of the power corridor of India that now has a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, and a revamped three-km-long iconic Kartavya Path from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate began in December 2020.

However, the revamp journey has been full of ups and downs. From Supreme Court halt orders to resistance from the Opposition, the project has seen it all.

By India Today Web Desk: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for unveiling the bronze statue of the National Emblem cast on the roof of the new Parliament building.

Asaduddin Owaisi accused PM Modi of violating all constitutional norms, saying that the National Emblem should have been unveiled by the Lok Sabha speaker instead.

Taking to micro-blogging site Twitter, the AIMIM chief said, ""Constitution separates powers of parliament, govt & judiciary.

After PM Modi unveiled the National Emblem, reactions also started pouring in from leaders from other opposition parties.

While talking to India Today, Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit questioned the total absence of opposition parties during the unveiling within the Parliament compound.

Further, AIMIM leader Waris Pathan told India Today, ""Prime Minister has violated the constitutional norms. The Constitution separates the power of Parliament, the government and the judiciary The country will run on the Constitution. We all have to follow the rule of law, we have to abide by the protocols and yet, will it decrease the present situation in, the countries will it normalize the economic situation of our country by spending so much of rupees on this? Will you get employment?""

Issuing the statement, Communist Party of India (Marxist) said, ""The Prime Minister unveiling the national emblem on top of the new Parliament building is a clear violation of the Indian Constitution.""

""The Constitution unambiguously separates the three wings of our democracy the Executive (government), the Legislature (Parliament and state assemblies) and the Judiciary. President summons the Parliament. Prime Minister is the head of the Executive. The Legislature has its independent role to perform, amongst others, to legislate laws, keep the Executive accountable and answerable,"" read the statement.

This Constitutional separation of powers between the three wings is being subverted by the head of the Executive, it said.

Further, the statement said that ""the Prime Minister performed a puja on the occasion. The Constitution of India gives the right and protection to all Indians to practice and profess their faith. This is an inalienable right. At the same time, the Constitution of India clearly stipulates that the State does not profess or practice any faith/religion.""

CPI(M) called upon PM Modi and the Union Government to ""scrupulously implement the solemn oath they have taken when assuming office swearing to protect and uphold the Constitution of India.""

Meanwhile, BJP leader Amit Malviya replied sharply to the allegations levied by the Opposition parties. He said that it is PM Modi's prerogative, as head of the government, to unveil the National Emblem atop the new Parliament building.

The 6.5m high bronze National Emblem cast on the roof of the new Parliament building weighs around 9,500 kg. The steel structure that would support the emblem weighs nearly 6,500 kg.

PM Modi also interacted with the workers involved in the work of the new Parliament. The massive bronze emblem underwent eight stages  from its conceptualisation to the final installation.

With critics wondering if the new building will match up to old one in its grandeur, Mishra said it will look like ""twin sister"" of the current one with its mosaic of red and yellow stones while being much ahead in terms of its occupancy, use of modern technologies and amenities.

Noting that the current parliament building was meant to be a ""meeting hall"" and retrofitted later and had two floors added, which resulted in lack of sunlight and cramped spaces, he said the new building will be inviting and look like a ""people's parliament"".

It will be truly a people's parliament and an ode to Modi's call for ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"", he said, adding that the new legislature will be realisation of the prime minister's vision as he has been keenly involved in the entire exercise from the beginning.

Highlighting the hectic pace of work, Mishra said over 4,800 workers are deployed at the site and 1,200 at different places, adding that so far six lakh man days have been created.

He said work has been going on in over 20 places across the country, ranging from those related to furniture, stones and electricals to technological features, regarding the new building.

Over 1.65 lakh cubic metre of soil was removed in 45 days, he said highlighting the scale of the work.

""It was disposed in a clinical manner that few would have noticed,"" he added.

So far, Mishra said, 1,13,625 cubic metre of concrete will be used at work and 72,000 cubic metre of it has been done so far.

With extensive use of corrosion-free steel and other modern construction features, the building's planned life currently is 200 years, he said.

He said new parliament building will meet construction requirement in seismic zone-5, which covers the regions most vulnerable to earthquakes even though the national capital falls in the zone-4, and will qualify for the top green rating of five-star platinum.

He also allayed apprehensions about the loss of trees due to the construction of the new building, saying no trees were cut but 404 of them were transplanted and 80 per cent of them have survived.

In their place, 4,400 saplings have been planted, he told reporters.

Mishra claimed the new buildings will have state-of-the-art technological features, making it secure against any security threats, including those emanating from cyberware.

""The new parliament building will be a monumental work of skill, speed and scale,"" he said.

With work going on round the clock, the new building will meet its October 2022 deadline, he asserted. The winter session next year will be held in the new building, he added.

By Poulomi Saha: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the 'Kartavya Path' - earlier named the Central Vista - today evening.

The revamped stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, with red granite walkways, renovated canals, food stalls offering dishes of the different states, and vending kiosks amid expansive greenery, symbolises a shift from Rajpath being an icon of power to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment.

At India Gate, the prime minister will unveil a statue of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, in line with one of his five pledges - paach pran - for a new India in the 'Amrit Kaal' - removing traces of the colonial mindset.

WHY THE REVAMP?

Over the years, Rajpath and adjoining areas of Central Vista Avenue have been grappling with increasing traffic of visitors.

Basic amenities - like public toilets, drinking water, street furniture and adequate parking space - were not available. There was inadequate signage, poor maintenance of water features and haphazard parking in the area, adding to the chaos.

Also Read: | Redeveloped Kartavya Path to be opened for public use soon | Watch

Besides, a bigger and well organized space was needed for national events to be held in a less disruptive manner, with minimal restrictions on public movement.

The redevelopment aims to address all these issues while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the area's architectural character.

DETAILS ABOUT KARTAVYA PATH

Beautified landscapes, lawns with walkways, added green spaces, refurbished canals, new amenity blocks, improved signage and vending kiosks are some of the things that will be seen at the Kartavya Path.

New pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting will add to the experience of visitors. A number of sustainability features - like solid waste management, stormwater management, recycling of used water, rainwater harvesting, water conservation and energy efficient lighting systems, among others - have been incorporated into the new design.

THE BOSE STATUE

Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's statue is being installed in the same place where his hologram statue was unveiled earlier this year on Parakram Diwas - January 23 (Netaji's birthday) - by PM Modi. Made of granite, the statue is a fitting tribute to Netaji's immense contribution to India's freedom struggle.

The 28-foot-tall structure has been carved from a monolithic granite stone and it weighs around 65 metric tonnes.

By Milan Sharma: The government is all set to work on a massive structural overhaul to create a completely new 'siege of power' for the Union government in the national capital, said sources in the Urban Affairs Ministry.

The Urban Affairs Ministry will undertake this huge facelift project to change the central vista, a 3.5 km stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhawan till India Gate made in the 1930s, according to top sources in the ministry.

The government plans to create a new parliament building and accommodate offices in the North and South Block. A common central secretariat, which could house offices of many ministries, has also been proposed.

According to sources, a request for proposal (RFP) has been floated for the project and plans are in preliminary stages. An RFP meeting is slated to take place on Thursday evening.

Sources in the government indicated that they had received representations from many members of parliament, who expressed a desire to have separate rooms within the parliament building to hold governance functions.

A common grievance was also that not many MPs could be accommodated with such requests in the existing structure. In addition, it was also revealed that the North and South Block is not structurally sound or even earthquake-proof.

The proposed changes in the central vista are also being envisaged as per international standards, like the ones made in the world's biggest capitals such as the one in Washington DC. The area is also one of the most visited by the public. The ministry has aimed at a deadline until 2024 for completion of projects.

As per sources, bids for the proposed project will be opened shortly. A high-level committee will be formed to chalk out the plan and execution. A firm is likely to be selected by October 15 to plan out the project.

Sources also said the government was being overburdened with an expenditure of about Rs 1,000 crore annually being paid as rent for government offices by the exchequer.

Government sources also added that they ""are at a stage to undertake companies which will be able to identify plans to execute this proposal.""

The cost estimation of the entire project has not been revealed. Currently, the government is open to all Indian and international firms who would come forward with plans for the massive restructuring.

By Press Trust of India: Drawing inspiration from the 'Chakravyuh' formation, the iconic National War Memorial, set to be unveiled on Monday, boasts of four thematic concentric circles with a tall ceremonial obelisk at its centre that will bear the eternal flame.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate the memorial, spread over 40 acres in the India Gate complex here, by lighting the flame positioned at the bottom of the stone-made obelisk.

Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Lt Gen P S Rajeshwar, during a briefing here, also said the Amar Jawan Jyoti built in 1972 underneath the India Gate arch to commemorate soldiers martyred in the Indo-Pak War of 1971, will continue to be there.

A senior defence official said the project has been executed at a cost of Rs 176 crore and its design was selected through a global competition.

The central part of the sprawling complex has been built in a sunken plot as the design had to respect the heritage look of the India Gate's Central Vista, officials said.

""The prime minister will dedicate the memorial to the nation tomorrow at a solemn function. The defence minister, chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force will be among the dignitaries present on the occasion,"" Rajeshwar said.

Modi spoke about the memorial in his 'Mann ki Baat' programme on Sunday, saying not having such a memorial always pained and surprised him.

""I do believe that for our countrymen, a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place. The national soldiers' memorial is a symbol of the nation's gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence,"" he said.

The names of 25,942 battle casualties have been inscribed across 16 walls that consist of granite pieces bearing the name, rank and regiment of the fallen heroes, the officials said, adding that it was built between February last year and this February in ""record time"".

The layout of the memorial located behind the India Gate canopy and across the National Stadium consists of four concentric circles, radially outwards, namely, the 'Amar Chakra' or Circle of Immortality, 'Veerta Chakra or Circle of Bravery, 'Tyag Chakra' or Circle of Sacrifice and 'Rakshak Chakra' or Circle of Protection, the senior official said.

The central obelisk is topped with an Ashokan Capital and the base bears the famous couplet 'Shaheed ki mazron par...' by poet Jagdamba Prasad Mishra 'Hitaishi'.

Six bronze murals, made by noted sculptor Ram Sutar, depicting famous battles fought by the Army, Air Force and Navy have been put up in a gallery in the Veerta Chakra zone, he added.

advertisement

Likewise, 16 walls in concentric fashion have been constructed in the 'Tyag Chakra' area for paying homage to the over 25,000 battle casualties.

The names of soldiers who have made supreme sacrifice have been inscribed in golden letters on granite tablets arranged in a circular pattern which symbolises the ancient Indian war formation 'Chakravyuh', the official said.

The outermost circle i.e. the 'Rakshak Chakra' comprises rows of more than 600 dense trees with each tree representing many soldiers who guard the territorial integrity of the nation round the clock, officials said.

Besides, the main complex, a Param Yoddha Sthal has also been built on the northern side of the India Gate's C-Hexagon area. The park is dotted with bronze busts of the 21 awardees, fifteen posthumously, of the Param Veer Chakra, country's highest wartime gallantry medal.

Lt Gen Rajeshwar said the memorial epitomises and showcase undaunted courage and exemplary valour displayed by the Indian soldiers, many of whom are unsung heroes.

""The memorial is also a place to inculcate among the next generation a high sense of national pride, patriotism, sacrifice and belongingness,"" he said.

advertisement

The memorial pays tribute to soldiers who laid down their lives defending the nation during Indo-China War in 1962, Indo-Pak Wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971, Indian Peace Keeping Force Operations in Srilanka and in the Kargil Conflict in 1999.

It also commemorates the soldiers who participated and made supreme sacrifice in the UN Peace Keeping Missions, during Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Operations, counter-insurgency operations and Low Intensity Capital Operation (LICO)

The India Gate itself is a war memorial built during the British Raj as the All India War Memorial Arch to honour the soldiers who died in the First World War (1914-1918) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919). The landmark has the names of soldiers inscribed on its surface.

Rose petals will be showered during the course of the event by helicopters and a fly-past in 'Missing Man' formation will also be part of the event.

PM Modi will also attend a rally of ex-servicemen at the National Stadium before unveiling the memorial.

On Sunday, he asked the ruling BJP not to turn India ""into a victim of its system"" in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He has squarely blamed the centre for the crisis of oxygen and medicine shortage.

The Wayanad MP had cancelled all his election rallies in West Bengal citing the Covid spiral and had urged others to do the same.

""The opposition wanted to use the money used in the Central Vista project to vaccinate more people. We could have bought more PPE kits, given direct transfers to migrant workers,"" Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien told NDTV.

The construction work for the Rs. 1,500 crore project has been brought under the ambit of ""essential services"", a move that has angered the opposition.

In Delhi, which is under a lockdown, construction work is permitted at construction sites where workers have been given on-site accommodation. But when NDTV did a spot check at the location, not many were found camping at the construction site.Most of the workers were found coming from Kirti Nagar - 16 km away - and adjoining areas.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

The Republic Day parade next year will be held on the refurbished Rajpath as the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, is expected to be completed by this November, officials said on Friday.

Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who reviewed the status of ongoing construction works, said citizens will get an avenue that they will be proud of.

""Reviewed the status of ongoing construction works of Central Vista Avenue project with the secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, officials of ministry and CPWD, contractor and architect Bimal Patel. The progress so far is satisfactory and on schedule. Citizens will get an avenue they will be proud of,"" he tweeted.

An official in the ministry said that the Rajpath redevelopment project includes large-scale stonework, construction of underpasses, underground amenities blocks and horticulture work and sufficient space for parking.

""Twelve bridges on artificial ponds are being built. People visiting Rajpath will have an amazing experience. The redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue will be completed by November and the Republic Day parade next year will be held on the newly-developed Rajpath,"" the official said.

Infrastructure firm Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited has been executing the project as part of the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday hit back at the Congress for attacking the government over its Central Vista redevelopment project, saying the party's discourse is ""bizarre"" as its leaders themselves had supported the idea when the UPA was in power.

The accusation comes hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the Narendra Modi government for executing the project, terming it a ""criminal wastage"", while asking the dispensation to focus on people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India's healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities,"" Mr Puri tweeted.

There are hundreds of projects being executed by various depts. Governance hasn't come to a standstill, unlike the Congress's times of policy paralysis.

In a series of tweets, the Union housing and urban affairs minister, whose ministry is executing the government's ambitious project, said the Central Vista is not a new project and alleged that during the UPA government, Congress leaders had written about the need for a new parliament.

""Congress doesn't stop at hypocrisy. Look at their shameful double face. During UPA, Congress leaders wrote about the need for a new parliament. The Speaker in 2012 wrote a letter to Urban Development Ministry for the same. And now they have the gall to oppose the same project?"" he said.

Mr Puri also accused the Congress and its allies of splurging on reconstructing an MLA hostel in Maharashtra and building a new Legislative Assembly building in Chhattisgarh, adding that ""If this is fine, what is the problem with Central Vista?""

Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged in a tweet: ""Central Vista is criminal wastage. Put people's lives at the centre- not your blind arrogance to get a new house!""

Hyderabad-based construction firm DEC Infrastructure has emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of the Executive Enclave that will house the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the Cabinet Secretariat, the India House and the National Security Council Secretariat, according to an official document.

DEC Infrastructure and Projects (India) Private Limited had quoted an amount of around Rs 1,189 crore, 10.44 per cent less than the Rs 1,328-crore cost estimated by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which has been executing the Narendra Modi government's ambitious Central Vista Redevelopment project.

The estimated cost also includes maintenance and housekeeping for five years.

Tata Projects Limited, which is constructing a new Parliament building, quoted Rs 1,407 crore, which is 5.97 per cent more than the estimated project cost.

Larsen and Toubro Limited had quoted a bid amount of around Rs 1,424 crore, according to the document.

Apart from the PMO, the Executive Enclave will house the Cabinet Secretariat, the India House and the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS).

The India House will be used as a conference facility like the Hyderabad House where high-level talks, especially with top visiting leaders of various countries, are currently held.

The new PMO will have three floors with a floor height of 4.75 metres, in addition to the basement and the ground floor, and the new Cabinet Secretariat and the NSCS will have the same building structure.

The Executive Enclave will come up on the south side of the South Block in plot number 36/38 in the high-security Lutyens' Delhi.

Tata Projects Limited is constructing a new Parliament building. In October last year, Larsen and Toubro Limited was awarded the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three buildings of the common Central Secretariat.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue stretching from Vijay Chowk to India Gate.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the country's power corridor, envisages a new Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat, revamping of the three-kilometre Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president's enclave.

The government has urged the Supreme Court to dismiss a petition against the Central Vista project, calling the plea ""misconceived"" and saying that it should be dismissed with costs.

The Supreme Court has asked the petitioner - who has challenged the project on grounds it will impact a ""public recreational"" zone - to file a response to the government's affidavit by November 12. The court will hear the matter next on November 16.

In its affidavit the government said the plot in question had been used for Defence Ministry offices for the past 90 years, and it had never been open for the public's 'recreation purposes'.

""Plot No 1 is currently being used as government offices / hutments of the Ministry of Defence for almost 90 years now and no recreational activity (neighbourhood play area) exists as per actual ground conditions. It is also averred that the place has not ever been open for the general public to utilise it for any public recreational purposes,"" the government affidavit stated.

""It is also submitted that there is no residing population or residential colony in the said vicinity and only office premises of Ministry of Defence are functioning in the said area. Hence, a 'neighbourhood play area' is not existing [nor is required], and is not therefore required to be in de-jure mentioned in the Master Plan,"" it added.

The court was also told the government had on its own decided to increase available public recreation areas in the Central Vista master plan; this is for the larger benefit of the public, it said.

""It is submitted that the respondents (the government) are cognisant of the public nature of the projects and specifically seek to add various public facilities to the larger vision plan and has, suo moto, created a lot of space for recreational purposes. It is submitted that there are both qualitative and quantitative increase in public spaces in larger vision,"" the government stressed.

On Monday a two-member bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice CT Ravikumar had given the government three days to respond to this petition.

The court had asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the government, if it had removed such an area from the plan or whether earlier recreational areas were to be relocated.

Mr Mehta had said it would not be possible to have a recreational area there because the new parliament building, as well as the residence of the Vice President were being built there.

""I will seek instructions from the government but because Parliament and Vice-President's house is coming up there, it would not be possible to have a recreational area in the vicinity,"" he had said.

The Central Vista Redevelopment Project involves a do-over of a 3.2 km stretch in the heart of Delhi, which was designed by the British before Independence, at the cost of Rs 20,000 crore.

Several government buildings, including Parliament House and ministry offices, will be rebuilt.

A number of petitions challenging the project have been filed, and have been dismissed - by both the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, neither of which has stopped the project so far.

The petition in question today was filed by social activist Rajeev Suri, who had originally challenged the project earlier citing illegal change in land use and absence of environmental clearance.

The petition against the Central Vista is ""sheer abuse of the process of law"" and yet another attempt to block the project, the Centre has told the Delhi High Court, requesting that the petition be scrapped with a fine.

The government also denies allegations in the petition that work on the project has continued even though workers don't live on site - a condition for construction activities during the lockdown in Delhi.

The petition by Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi requests that the Central Vista project be paused as hundreds of workers are being exposed to Covid.

The Centre says the project in the petition is not what is referred to as ""the Central Vista project"" (which includes Parliament, refurbishment of the North Block, South Block, construction of new offices for central government) but is ""limited to the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue or Rajpath"", where the Republic Day parade is held. It says the project at Rajpath involves building public amenities like toilet blocks, paths, parking spaces, four pedestrian underpasses and the ""improvement of canals, bridges, lawns, lights etc"". The work is to be completed by November, according to the government.

""This is very important public space and most widely visited by common public and tourists in Delhi,"" the Centre says.

On allegations that the workers are not staying on site, the government says about 400 workers were hired well before the April 19 curfew. And while their stay on the site was being arranged, permission was sought for transporting materials and labour from another part of the city to the work site. The permission was granted on April 19 (the day curfew was imposed) and was valid till April 30, the government says.

A Covid compliant facility has been installed at worksite to accommodate 250 workers who wanted to stay there and a medical facility has also been set up for testing and isolation, the Centre's affidavit claims, submitting photos as evidence.

The petition has ""resorted to falsehood and suppression of material facts as all on site arrangements were in the public domain"", the Centre says, accusing the petitioner of not physically verifying facts.

""The fact that out of all these construction activities going on simultaneously for different projects by different agencies, the petitioner has chosen to be a 'public spirited citizen' only with regard to one project only speaks volumes about his intentions and motive behind filing the present petition that too suppressing all these facts,"" the Centre says.

That that petitioner ""rushed"" to file a petition before the High Court when the project has been on for some time, and then approached the Supreme Court when the hearing was adjourned for a week raised questions on whether it was a ""bona fide litigant"", the Centre said.

Highlights PM is to perform groundbreaking ceremony for new Parliament building

Ahead of tomorrow's event, PM Modi received a letter from KCR

Central Vista project is a ""project of national importance"", KCR wrote

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, set to symbolically launch a part of the ambitious Central Vista project tomorrow, received a letter of congratulations from Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao calling it a ""project of national importance"" and a symbol of national pride and self-esteem.

""The new Central Vista project will be a symbol of self-esteem, prestige and national pride of a resurgent, confident and strong India. I wish for the speedy completion of this prestigious and nationally important project,"" Mr Rao, popularly known as KCR, wrote in the brief letter.

He said the project was long overdue as the existing government infrastructure in the national capital is ""inadequate and also associated with our colonial past"".

PM Modi is to perform a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Parliament building that will be built at nearly Rs 1,000 crore as part of the grand Central Vista project to refurbish buildings in the seat of power in Delhi.

The event was allowed by an upset Supreme Court, which rebuked the government for ""moving forward aggressively"" on the project even before its decision on petitions challenging the plan over environmental concerns.

""You can lay the foundation stone, you can carry on paperwork but no construction or demolition, no cutting down any trees,"" the Supreme Court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the government.

The Rs. 20,000-crore Central Vista project seeks to redevelop a 3-km stretch from the presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. The project will be aligned along Rajpath, the ceremonial road between the two buildings, and form the seat of the government that will start with the North Block. The project has drawn criticism from opposition parties, historians and green activists.

KCR probably hopes his praise for the PM's pet project will take some of the sting off the ruling BJP's attack over his decision to demolish a historic 150-year-old secretariat building in Hyderabad, showing skewed priorities at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. The Chief Minister, who believes in Vastu, wants a new office building at the cost of Rs 600 crores with six floors - he considers the number ""six"" lucky.

The sweeping move made for bad optics for the Chief Minister, whose Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) recently won the Hyderabad civic polls by a vastly reduced margin, with the BJP scoring big gains at its cost and emerging as the main opposition.

The TRS yesterday even participated in the nationwide Bharat Bandh or shutdown in support of farmers ranged against the BJP-led central government and raised slogans against PM Modi.

The government ""must not be stubborn"" and should roll back the 'Agnipath' scheme, senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot said.

The new scheme was announced on Tuesday to bring down the average age of personnel and reduce pension expenditure for India's 1.38 million-strong armed forces.

Criticising the move, Mr Pilot said that the government should have reconsidered projects like Central Vista Avenue. ""If the government wanted to reduce pension bills, then there were other ways too. The two planes bought for Prime Minister could have been avoided.

Protests broke out in various parts of the country after the government announced the new scheme on Tuesday. In some places, the protests turned violent as trains were set on fire.

Yesterday, dozens of bloating, decomposed bodies washed up on the banks of Ganga at Bihar's Buxar in terrifying visuals that spooked the villagers. The authorities believe the bodies floated down from Uttar Pradesh and belong to Covid patients whose relatives may have been unable to find space to cremate or bury them.

On Saturday, several partially burnt bodies were seen floating in the Yamuna at Hamirpur town. The Congress had alleged these bodies are proof of the untold hidden Covid deaths.

The Delhi High Court today is set to hear an application seeking a stay on all construction work at the Central Vista.

According to the disaster management authority, all construction activities have been stopped except where labourers are residing on-site but the workers for the Central Vista project are being ferried in buses from various locations in Delhi.

At a meeting of the party's highest decision-making body on Monday, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi targeted the government for pursuing the grand project instead of providing free vaccination to all.

""Every expert has said that it would have made more sense and it would have been financially more equitable for the Centre to bear the costs. But we know (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi government has other priorities, pursuing grandiose projects against the force of public opinion and the face of widespread criticism,"" said the Congress chief.

On May 9, Rahul Gandhi put up two contrasting pictures - people standing in a long queue with oxygen cylinders next to them and a dug-up India Gate due to ongoing construction work for the Central Vista - and captioned it ""People need Oxygen not PM's residence"".

""Congress's discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about Rs 20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination!

Ahluwalia Contracts India Limited on Tuesday emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of Executive Enclave as part of the Central Vista project that will house the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), cabinet secretariat, India House and the National Security Council Secretariat, official document showed.

The company, headquartered in Delhi, quoted an amount of around Rs 1,119 crore, 3.50 per cent less than the Rs 1,160-crore cost estimated by the CPWD, which has been executing the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista Redevelopment project.

Tata Projects Limited, which is constructing a new Parliament building, quoted Rs 1,154 crore. NCC Limited quoted a bid amount of around Rs 1,158 crore and Larsen & Toubro Limited around Rs 1,317 crore, the document showed.

An official said the lowest bidder is usually awarded the contract and added the Board of Central Public Works Department (CPWD) will decide on awarding the tender in the next few days.

The CPWD had estimated the cost of construction and maintenance of the Executive Enclave at Rs 1,160.17 crore.

The Executive Enclave will come up on the south side of the South Block in plot number 36/38 in the high-security Lutyens' Delhi.

The bid document states the new PMO will have three floors each 4.75 metres high, in addition to the basement and ground floor. The new cabinet secretariat and the National Security Council Secretariat will have a similar structure.

India House, which will have one floor in addition to basement and ground floor, is likely to be used as a conference facility like the Hyderabad House where high-level talks, especially with top visiting leaders of various countries, are held now.

According to the CPWD's bid document, the project will be completed within 24 months of initiation of the construction work.

""The (Executive) Enclave will be designed to improve potency and functioning through carefully planned formation of different departments with supporting facilities. This will ensure prime security and excellent interconnectivity within the Enclave and with other offices in Central Vista.

""Relocating these departments will also ensure efficient security protocols for VIPs and VVIPs without disturbing daily movement of the public in and around the Central Vista,"" the CPWD document states.

In October last year, Larsen & Toubro Limited had been awarded the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue stretching from Vijay Chowk to the India Gate.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president enclave.

The project involves a do-over of a 3.2 km stretch in the heart of Delhi - designed by the British before Independence - at the cost of Rs 20,000 crore.

In his petition, social activist Rajeev Suri had said that land use in some areas was changed from ""public recreational"" to ""residential"" for the project. He argued that it would affect the area currently meant for public recreation.

Today, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court the Centre is ""increasing green area as part of the holistic development.""

It's the prerogative of the authorities concerned to make changes in the development plan, the top court said in response to the plea, underling that it is ""a policy matter.""

The government had urged the court to reject the ""misconceived"" petition.

The plot in question, the government said, had been used by Defence Ministry for years and the government on its own has decided to increase various public recreation areas in the master plan of Central Vista, for the larger benefit of the public.

The redevelopment project is expected to be completed next year, when India celebrates 75 years of Independence. Several government buildings, including the Parliament House and ministry offices, will be rebuilt as part of the project.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that it will hear tomorrow a petition seeking to stop construction activity in the Central Vista Project in compliance with orders issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority during the subsistence of the peak phase of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that the Centre has filed a reply to the petition.

A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh noted that reply was not on record and directed to bring the Center's affidavit on record.

Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra, who was representing the petitioner, told the court that the issue concerns a specific area where construction is going on unabated.

On Monday, the matter was mentioned by senior advocate Siddharth Luthra for preponement of the date of hearing as it was earlier listed for May 17 for a detailed hearing.

The bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh on Monday asked him to file an application and said that they would hear the matter tomorrow. Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra also informed the bench about the Supreme Court's direction in this regard.

On May 7, the Supreme Court urged Delhi High Court to consider the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by petitioner Anya Malhotra seeking a stay in construction work of the Central Vista project in New Delhi amid the prevailing condition of coronavirus cases across the country and asked High Court to issue orders related to the matter.

Petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi were represented by senior advocate Sidharth Luthra in the matter who stated that the petition is concerned with the ongoing construction activity in the part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project designated as 'Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project' and is challenging Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and CPWD's relentless, unmindful and reckless act of carrying on this project in a manner that poses a threat to the lives of the citizens of Delhi and beyond, including the lives of the workforce/labour engaged in the Project, as it has the potential of being a super spreader, and is in clear breach and violation of the Orders passed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.

The plea stated that, at a time when the city of Delhi is grappling with a devastating coronavirus outbreak and when all efforts, particularly and more so by the State and its agencies, have to be towards controlling the spiralling situation, the impugned acts of the Respondents, will nullify and negate all those efforts.

The plea also stated that the Petitioners are also questioning why or how the Project constitutes an ""essential service"", merely because some executive mandated contractual deadline has to be met.

Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma appeared for Union of India earlier had opposed the plea and said petition is of doubtful credentials.

In December 2020, the Central Vista Development Project was inaugurated by PM Modi. The Project intends to revamp 86 acres of land in Delhi, which includes Rajpath, Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, North Block, and South Block, Shastri Bhavan, India Gate, and Udyog Bhavan.

The project envisages the construction of a new Parliament building, a common secretariat for central government offices, the Prime Minister's office, and residence, the Special Protection Group building, and the Vice-President Enclave.

There is no loss of green cover due to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the government told Parliament on Monday, saying it will instead enhance the greenery by 5.4 acres in the area for public use.

Responding to a query in Rajya Sabha, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the ministry has issued Terms of Reference (ToR) for preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for Development/Redevelopment of Common Central Secretariat Buildings, Central Conference Centre along with other buildings by the Central Public Works Department.

The minister, however, said that the proposal for grant of environmental clearance in this respect is not yet received.

""The ToR issued to the project, inter-alia, includes assessment of the environmental impact due to development activities within Central Vista Avenue and the preparation of Environmental Management Plan by the project proponent.

""As per project proponent (Central Public Works Department), there is no loss of green cover due to Central Vista Redevelopment Project. However, overall green cover is enhanced by 5.4 acre in Central Vista avenue for public use,"" Mr Javadekar said in his response.

He said that the Ministry has granted Environment Clearance (EC) for expansion and renovation of Existing Parliament Building by M/s Central Public Works Department, Parliament House at plot number 116 and 118 at Central Vista, New Delhi.

""The EC issued to the project, mandates conditions including, inter-alia, compliance to the 2018 Notification of the ministry of environment regarding dust mitigation measures for construction and demolition activities; implementation of plan to contain exceedance in ambient air quality at the site; implementation of Traffic Management Plan, etc. without any tree cutting,"" he said.

Environment ministry's expert appraisal committee (EAC) had recommended clearance for the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project with a direction to the CPWD, who are the developers, to ensure no air pollution is caused during the demolition process.

The decision was taken in a meeting held on December 17, 2020.

With the EAC giving its nod and recommending to grant terms of reference (ToR), the project came a step closer to getting environment clearance (EC), which has to be given by the Union Environment Minister.

The centre drew sharp criticism for its grandiose plan to redevelop the Central Vista, with environment experts contending that the Rs 13,450 crore project was government's way of ""pampering itself"" without considering that the project is going to sacrifice huge green cover and make the air toxic with its construction and demolition dust.

The Supreme Court had in January given its nod to the project in a 2:1 majority verdict while insisting that the clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work.

The HCC is headed by Special/Additional Secretary of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

Highlights Union Minister Hardeep Puri said no heritage building would be touched

He said new Parliament Building is a ""necessity"", not a vanity project

He said no design had been cleared for a new PM's residence till now

Hours after the Delhi High Court rejected a challenge to the Central Vista project, Union Minister Hardeep Puri said a false narrative was being propagated over the plan and that ""no heritage building would be touched"". He also defended the cost of the big ticket makeover and said it had no bearing on the procurement of vaccines.

Mr Puri asserted that no design had been cleared for a new Prime Minister's residence and only two projects - the Parliament building and the widening of the central vista stretch - were on track.

He conceded that the pandemic had impacted the project's timeline and plans for the new PM's residence and Vice President's house had been delayed. ""We didn't visualise the pandemic, the virus. There is a whole process so our schedule will be delayed to 2024 -2025,"" he told reporters.

""Currently, two new projects are underway- the New Parliament Building and Central Vista Avenue. A decision on these projects was taken before the pandemic. The total cost of the project is around Rs 1300 crore,"" the Union Minister said.

The decision to construct a new Parliament building was, in fact, taken in 2012 when the Congress was in power, he added.

The Parliament building is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs. 862 crores and the Central Vista Avenue at Rs. 477 crores. ""The total cost of the project construction currently underway is around Rs 1,300-odd crores... We want to finish the new Parliament building by 2022 to mark 75 years of independence,"" Mr Puri told reporters.

He also asserted that this was ""not a vanity project but a necessary project"" as the current building was in a seismic zone.

Tackling criticism of the project with visuals of a dug-up Rajpath viral online, the minister said the ""Centra Vista"" and ""Centra Vista Avenue"" were being freely interchanged.

""None of the historic iconic cultural buildings will be touched. They will remain exactly as they are,"" he said.

Mr Puri hit out at the opposition's taunts about the government prioritizing the Rs 15,000 crore project at a time it needs to buy more vaccines. ""There will be enough money for this and advance payments have been made till August. There will be enough of vaccines for everyone by December. The PM is personally monitoring this vaccine policy and will ensure everyone will get the vaccine,"" he assured on a day the Supreme Court sought a detailed response on the Centre's vaccine policy.

A new Prime Minister's residence complex, a new parliament building and new headquarters for various ministries are part of a massive refurbishment plan for central Delhi, home to historic buildings designed by British architect Edwin Lutyens.

The plan has provoked a huge outcry among opposition parties and on social media over objections ranging from the impact on Delhi's green cover to destroying Delhi's most historically significant landmarks.

Earlier, Mr Puri had denied a Times of India report that claimed work on the PM's residence would start in August. Calling the report ""amusing"", he clarified: ""Conceptual designs of PM Residence have still not been presented to the Ministry. Further, before construction starts, the design has to be finalised, approved and works have to be awarded after tendering.""

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a fresh challenge to the redevelopment project and fined the petitioner Rs 1 lakh, describing as ""motivated"" a petition that asked for construction to be stopped as workers were exposed to Covid. The centre had argued in court that the petition was ""sheer abuse of the process of law"", and yet another attempt to block the project.

The Central Public Works Department will transplant 487 trees for the construction of an 'Executive Enclave' as part of the Central Vista redevelopment plan, according to official documents.

The Executive Enclave will house the new Prime Minister's Office, Cabinet Secretariat, India House and National Security Council Secretariat.

According to a revised proposal for grant of environmental clearance to the Rs 1,381-crore project, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) will maintain 1,022 trees at the site, so as to have a tree per 80 square metre of plot area as per the guidelines of the Union environment ministry.

It said there are 807 trees at the site as compared to the earlier estimate of 784.

In a meeting held on April 9, the Delhi State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) recommended the revised proposal to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) for grant of environmental clearance.

The SEAC had earlier raised concern over CPWD's proposal to ""remove and transplant"" 630 trees from the site.

Accordingly, the CPWD revised the proposal, decreasing the number of trees to be transplanted to 487 and increasing the number of trees to be retained at the site to 320 from 154.

The CPWD informed the SEAC that 397 trees will be transplanted at Raj Ghat and 90 on a plot in the vicinity.

The project proponent will plant an additional 702 trees at the site to meet the criteria of a tree per 80 square metre of plot area, it told the SEAC.

A compensatory plantation of 4,870 trees will be raised at NTPC, Badarpur.

A total of five buildings with a built-up area of 90,000 square metres will be constructed at the site after demolishing the built-up area of 47,000 sqm.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict Tuesday on a batch of pleas, which have questioned several aspects including the environmental clearance granted to ambitious Central vista project.

The Central Vista revamp, announced in September, 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project against which various pleas have been filed.

A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna will pronounce the verdict on the batch of pleas on which it had reserved its verdict on November 5, last year.

On December 7, last year the top court had allowed the Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project on December 10 after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the top court decides the pending pleas on the issue.

Centre had told the bench that there would be only foundation stone-laying ceremony, and no construction, demolition or felling of trees would be done for the project as of now.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone on December 10, last year, for the new Parliament building and the construction is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had said on December 5, last year.

The top court had earlier said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be ""at their own risk"".

It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

On November 5, the top court had reserved its verdict on a batch of pleas which have raised questions over the Centre's ambitious Central Vista project, which covers 3 km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

The Centre had earlier argued in the top court that the project would ""save money"" which is paid as rent for housing central government ministries in the national capital.

It had submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.

The Centre had also said there was no arbitrariness or favouritism in selecting consultant for the project and the argument that the government could have adopted a better process cannot be a ground to scrap the project.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the nod to change of land use.

The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building.

One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The stay order of the high court on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices.

The latest petition involving the government's prestige project is by social activist Rajeev Suri, the original petitioner who had challenged the Central Vista project earlier citing illegal change in land use and absence of environmental clearance.

Earlier petitions were dismissed by both the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, and the project was not stopped.

Rajeev Suri says in his new petition that land use in some areas are being changed from ""public recreational"" to ""residential"" for the Central Vista project. He argues that it would affect the area currently meant for public recreation.

Justice AM Khanwilkar asked the Solicitor General if the government had removed such an area from the plan or whether the earlier recreational areas were to be relocated to some other areas.

Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for one of the petitioners, told the court that till April 19, there were no restrictions for construction sites. A tough lockdown was then announced in Delhi to check the spread of Covid, and restrictions were put in place for construction projects, he highlighted.

While the case was pending, he argued, the petitioner was concerned with the health of construction workers when the second Covid wave had hit its peak. The request, he insisted, was not to stop the entire project but the construction in some specific parts.

For other projects, it was stressed, the authorities followed the norms.

""During the pendency of this plea, all conditions on Covid protocol were followed. Despite that, petitioners pursued the petition for reasons best known to them,"" the top court replied.

Last month, the Delhi High Court had rejected the petition, and said no question arises of suspending construction work amid the pandemic as ""the labourers are staying at the site"".

The offices of the Navy, Army and Air Force are also spread across several parts of central Delhi, including the Lutyens' Zone. Many operate from hutments near the North and South Blocks.

""There are currently various offices of the defence ministry at many places. They will now have their own large ''Defence Enclave'' that is also required from security point of view. The new enclave will be constructed by 2026 and this will be part of the ten buildings to be constructed under the common central secretariat,"" a source told PTI.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new prime minister''s residence and prime minister''s office, and a new vice president enclave.

""The land where the vice president's house exists at present will also be used for the new enclave along with the nearby land,"" the source said.

According to the six-year timeline of the redevelopment project, the new parliament building will be completed by November 2022, the prime minister's residence by December 2022, vice president's enclave by September 2022, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) by April 2023, MP chambers by March 2024, National Archives of India by June 2024 and Central Conference Centre by December 2026 among others.

The Delhi State-level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) has observed that the CPWD's proposal to construct an executive enclave as part of the Central Vista redevelopment plan will remove an ""excessively high proportion"" of trees, according to an official document.

The executive enclave will house new Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Cabinet Secretariat, India House and National Security Council Secretariat. The minutes of the SEAC meeting dated January 31 stated that the total project cost is Rs 1,381 crore.

The SEAC has asked the CPWD, the nodal body of the Central Vista redevelopment project, to revise its plans to enhance the ""requisite number of tree plantations"".

According to the minutes of the meeting, the plan has also asked the CPWD to furnish a complete plan for transplantation of trees with detail of the proposal for the survival of transplanted trees along with the layout indicating the location of trees with reasons/justification for transplanting the trees within the project sites.

The minutes of the meeting said the panel has sought revised plan for environment clearance and additional information from the CPWD.

The CPWD informed the panel of SEAC that 784 trees are present at the site and out of which 154 are proposed to be retained and 630 trees are proposed to be transplanted.

Noting that around 80 percent of the existing trees are proposed to be removed, the SEAC panel said it is an ""excessively high proportion"".

SEAC asked the CPWD to furnish details regarding ""an existing tree inventory with species and girth of each tree may be prepared, along with a baseline gees area map, showing all trees - - (a) trees to be retained, (b) trees to be removed due to building ground coverage, (c) and trees to be removed due to additional paved area. The attempt may be made to increase the trees to be retained"".

Meanwhile, out of six construction firms which had submitted technical bids to construct the executive enclave, two firms --- M/s Shapoorji Pallonji and Co. Pvt. Ltd and M/s PSP Projects Ltd --- could not qualify recently for submission of financial bids, CPWD's official document shows.

Larsen & Toubro, TATA Projects Ltd, NCC Ltd and Ahluwalia Contracts (lndia) Ltd will have to submit financial bids to be opened next month.

In October last year, Larsen & Toubro Limited had been awarded the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat.

Tata Projects Limited is constructing a new parliament building while Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited has executed the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue stretching from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation' power corridor, envisages a new parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president enclave.

The CPWD has decided to transplant 1,838 trees from the campus of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), which is proposed to be demolished for the construction of three new office buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The Central Public Works Department has invited bids according to which the agency concerned will have to transplant trees in 60 days and 365 days will be for the maintenance of the transplanted trees.

The CPWD said the entire project will be executed at an estimated cost of around Rs 1.86 crore.

Last month, the CPWD had invited bids for three new office buildings under the Common Central Secretariat along Rajpath at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore and Rs 139 crore was set aside for five year's maintenance.

These three new buildings will come on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located.

According to the bids for the transplantation of trees, there are 2,219 trees (approximately) on plot number 137, out of which 1,838 trees (approximately) are to be transplanted.

There are 1,150 trees having girth up to 50 cm, which will be transplanted, the bids stated, adding that there are also 401 trees which have girth beyond 50 cm and up to 90 cm.

In bid documents, the CPWD said it is proposed to avoid cutting of trees to the maximum extent and instead transplant the affected trees, within the site or in the vicinity, in a phased manner.

The girth and height of the tree will be measured and recorded before the start of any activity, the CPWD said, adding that photographs of each tree before the start of the process of translocation will be submitted by the bidder. The tree will be geo-tagged before and after transplantation.

""Lifting of trees shall be carried out or supervised by a qualified and/or suitably experienced person and crane operator using a crane and supports. It shall be ensured that there is no damage to the soil ball or any scratching and splitting of the root system. The tree should be kept intact without injuries to its root system, trunk and crown,"" it stated.

The entire process of translocation will be video graphed and submitted fortnightly to the CPWD. Penalty of Rs 5,000 will be imposed if the agency fails to do so.

The agency will carry out a social audit and get certified ""survival assessment report"" at the end of each maintenance sub-period (quarterly) to ascertain survival rate.

The shifting of employees of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces from hutments near the South Block will pave the way for the construction of the new PMO and the PM's residence under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

At the inauguration of two swanky office buildings on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also launched the dedicated website of Centre Vista which has details of ongoing and proposed projects, and also counters ""myths"" about the government's ambitious redevelopment plan.

According to the Central Vista website, the PMO is to be relocated to a new office proposed on the plot nos. 36 and 38 behind the South Block, after shifting of hutments.

""The Cabinet Secretariat, National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) and a conferencing facility like Hyderabad House of MEA shall also be located together with the PMO. Together, this ensemble will form the Executive Enclave,"" the website, operated by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs, stated.

High-level talks, especially with top visiting leaders of various countries, are currently held in the Hyderabad House. The historic edifice has been hosting top international leaders for decades.

A senior official in the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which has been executing the Central Vista redevelopment project, said that since employees of the Defence Ministry and armed forces will be shifting to two new buildings at KG Marg and Africa Avenue, the work of removing hutments will soon begin.

The Vice President's Residence is currently located on Maulana Azad Road. A new Vice President's Residence is proposed to be constructed after the shifting of hutments behind the North Block.

The Central Vista project website also contains information with regard to shifting of ministries and departments functioning from the Shram Shakti Bhawan and Transport Bhawan to GPOA II at KG Marg. By March 2022, the project will be completed.

Chambers of Members of Parliament will be constructed at the place of Transport Bhawan and Shram Shakti Bhawan.

According to the plan, 54 National Defence College (NDC) suites which are currently housed at Raksha Bhawan will be temporarily relocated to GPOA II at KG Marg.

North and South Blocks, which currently house the most important ministries, will serve as the National Museum after being retrofitted and refurbished, and upgraded to world-class facilities.

The central plaza between the two blocks will be a space for installations, where programmed performances and public activities will allow citizens and tourists to engage with the splendours of this complex, even after museum hours, according to the Central Vista website.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new Prime Minister's residence and PMO, and a new Vice President's enclave.

The Central Vista website also seeks to bust ""myths"" and counters allegations made by the Opposition regarding the Central Vista project.

Countering the claim of Rs 20,000 crore being spent on the Central Vista project this year during COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry stated in the website that till date, only two projects -- the new parliament building with tendered cost Rs 862 crore and the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost Rs 477 crore -- have been awarded and works are underway.

""Expenditure incurred on these two projects till March 2021 is Rs 195 crore and budget provision for 2021-22 is Rs 790 crore,"" it also said.

Buildings being constructed under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project will have a robust fire safety system in place, with the Delhi Fire Service giving its clearance to seven proposals in the last two years for structural plans that include a new prime minister's office and a new Parliament building, officials said on Wednesday.

They said that the stairwell pressurisation system, which is a mechanical ventilation, will also be in place in buildings like a new Parliament building, a new PMO building, amenity block and common central secretariat, besides Rajpath.

Most of the buildings under the Central Vista project have been divided into fire sub-compartments having fire resistant walls on all sides including top and bottom, which will help them contain fire within its origin, according to fire safety officials.

Delhi Fire Service Director Atul Garg said that the buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project will have a state-of-the-art technology as far as the fire safety is considered.

""We have tried to provide the best infrastructure for the fire safety system. This is going to have in-built fire safety systems with a set up of a huge fire control room as well,"" Mr Garg told PTI.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista  the nation's power corridor  envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, the revamping of the three-kilometre-long Rajpath from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and a prime minister's office, and a new vice president's enclave.

The DFS director also said that all due precautions have been taken with reference to the fire safety system of the buildings.

Officials said that DFS's recommendations include an internal road for fire tenders movement besides provisions for a fire check door for the protection of exits and staircases.

Sanjay Kumar Tomar, Deputy Chief Fire Officer, said, the major recommendations include a fire safety arrangement, escape route and means of accessing and exiting the building in terms of number, width, type and arrangement of sufficient exits.

The proposals were cleared by the DFS after the building designs were presented for approval by the government. Each of the seven proposals consist of plans for more than two buildings which were cleared between 2020-2022.

Mr Tomar said that various in-built fire-fighting arrangements have also recommended to be installed in the buildings such as a fire exit, a hose reel, a wet riser, hydrants, an automatic sprinkler system, internal hydrants and yard hydrants, pumping arrangements, and captive water storage for fire-fighting.

""Automatic fire detection and alarming system, manual-operated electric fire alarm system and a public address system have been recommended in accordance with National Building Code of India Chapter 4 on fire and fire safety.

""All the recommendations suggested are being followed and implemented in the building designs which had altered,"" the officer said.

According to fire department officials, initially it was not easy to convince the architects of the project to make certain specific changes in terms of fire safety system as they were of the view that any such changes could affect the beauty of the buildings.

""However, after a lot of discussions and at least seven-eight rounds of meetings held with our retired service providers, architects and consultants involved in the project, they agreed to make all the necessary suggestions recommended by the fire department to ensure an efficient fire safety system,"" DFS director Atul Garg told PTI.

Fire compartmentation, protection of exits through fire check doors, fire resistant material for construction of buildings as per unified by laws 2016 were also made to be incorporated in the design of the buildings, he said.

The buildings will also have a smoke management system -- a very important provision to control smoke in case of fire, the fire officials said.

The buildings provide safe passage for the occupants and also facilitate fire-fighters to locate the origin of fire. This helps in controlling fire early leading to less damage, Mr Tomar said.

Earlier this month, a CPWD official had said that all-out efforts are being made to finish the remaining work of the new Parliament building so that the Winter Session is held there.

Recently, the government told the Lok Sabha that 70 per cent of the physical progress of the new Parliament building project has been achieved and the targeted date of completion is November 2022.

A plea was filed in the Supreme Court today challenging the Delhi High Court's May 31 verdict which dismissed a petition seeking to suspend all construction activity of the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment during the COVID-19 pandemic while describing it as a ""vital"" and ""essential"" project of national importance.

The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi.

The main Cental Vista project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the Prime Minister and the Vice President. It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries 'offices.

The high court had dismissed the plea saying it was ""motivated"" and filed with ""ill-intent"" and ""lack of bona fides"".

The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted the work to be halted in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, observing that it was ""not a genuine public interest litigation"".

Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav on Wednesday filed the petition in the Supreme Court challenging the high court verdict.

Mr Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was not justified in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence.

It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a serious public health issue concern.

It claimed that the high court was not justified in holding that the construction activities for the project is essential activities, especially when the entire activities of service sector, industrial sector and the activities of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are fully suspended during the peak pandemic lockdown period.

In its verdict, the high court had said, ""The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. This work is part and parcel of Central Vista project and of vital public importance. The construction of Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project cannot be seen in isolation.

""In fact, the whole Central Vista project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project,"" it had said.

The high court had said that legality of the project was already upheld by the Supreme Court and even the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed it to continue.

It had also said that from the affidavits filed by the Centre and the contractor -- Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd (SPCPL) -- it was ""clearly evident"" that several facilities, like accommodation, medical facilities and Covid care centre, have been provided to the workers at the site.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday morning inaugurated new Defence Ministry offices in Delhi and, as he did so, he took a swipe at the opposition over the contentious Central Vista project.

He accused critics of the ambitious Rs 20,000 crore project - which includes building a new Parliament and central government offices, as well as the refurbishment of the North and South Blocks - of caring more about ""personal agendas"" than the condition of key government offices and ministries.

""We all saw how some people tried to sabotage the important Central Vista project... how they ran personal agendas to spread misinformation. But not once did they speak about the condition of these hutments... from where our ministries work. Not once did they mention the new Defence Ministry complexes and how crucial they are,"" the Prime Minister declared.

""... if they had done so, their lies and agendas would have been exposed,"" he claimed, hitting out at opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi; in May the Congress MP called the Central Vista a ""criminal wastage"" of resources and urged the government to divert money to battling the pandemic.

Mr Gandhi and the Congress have urged the government to halt the project and prioritise upgrading medical infrastructure. The Congress has also hit out at the government for categorising the project as an ""essential service"", which allowed construction to proceed despite the pandemic and lockdown.

The Prime Minister, however, today said that the new Defence Ministry offices - which will house 7,000 officials across two complexes on Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue in central Delhi - reflected his government placing ""highest priority and honour"" to the nation's armed forces.

The old offices - around 700 hutments spread over 50 acres - will be redeveloped to house a new 'Executive Enclave', which will include a new residence for the Prime Minister.

""It always surprised me that the Defence Ministry, like some others, was run from World War II-era hutments... these were made keeping horses and stables in mind. I always wondered how such important ministries were being run from old, dilapidated hutments..."" he said.

""This (the new offices) is a big step towards the construction of a modern Defence Ministry enclave in the capital... (which will) further strengthen our efforts to make the working (conditions) of our armed forces more convenient and more effective,"" Prime Minister Modi declared.

""This is all part of Central Vista - something those with false agendas and spreading misinformation will never acknowledge. You can now see the important work being done under this project.""

The Prime Minister also threw in a swipe at ""media houses in Delhi"", asking why they had failed to cover this - ""the conditions in which our important ministries were functioning"".

Union Ministers took to social media to hail the Prime Minister's speech. Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani declared the new offices would ""prove to be effective in making the functioning of our forces more smooth, effective and empowered'.

The Central Vista project has generated massive controversy and criticism, with critics and opposition leaders questioning the need to spend thousands of crores on government buildings instead of spending it on vaccine development and distribution or scaling up health infrastructure.

Other criticisms of the project range from its impact on Delhi's green cover to the destruction of some of the city's most historically significant landmarks.

The government has dismissed all criticism, insisting that the project had been conceived in September 2019 (before the pandemic) and that no historic buildings will be demolished.

It has also dismissed reports the costs will divert funds from the nation's Covid vaccination efforts, saying ""there is enough money... advance payments (for vaccines) have been made till August (and) there will be enough vaccines for everyone by December"".

""These two segments are actually the showcase segment (of the Central Vista redevelopment project),"" he said, adding that these projects will be completed within the time period.

The minister said that the new Parliament building will be constructed at a cost of around Rs 800 crore, while the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment work will be completed at around Rs 400 crore.

Besides, the government had floated tenders for the construction of three new buildings of Common Central Secretariat on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located

Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri, on Saturday, said that Central Vista Avenue is completely ready with its new effect.

Talking to ANI at Central Vista Avenue, Mr Puri said that after the redevelopment, the green coverage has been increased. ""Central Vista Avenue itself has been widened. Now, the walkways are of 12 to 15 kilometres. The water bodies have been cleaned. It's a new effect"", the Union Minister added.

While talking about the challenges faced during the completion of the Central Vista project, Mr Puri said, ""The meaning of challenge is that you have to meet the challenge. The challenge has been met and it has been met in a timely manner.""

'Despite the COVID pandemic, 4,000 people had been working round the clock. So, I am grateful to them, I am grateful to my colleague and ministry. Whenever we had required their cooperation, we got in full measure from all departments"", he added.

Mr Puri criticised the opposition parties' remarks over the Central Vista project. ""First they were told that this project would not be completed in a timely manner. Second, there was some concern from the environmentalists. But we addressed everything.""

According to him, out of 25 trees, 22 trees have been relocated to other places. ""I am hopeful that the new Parliament building will also be complete by October this year"", said the Union Minister.

It is worth mentioning that after the completion of Central Vista Avenue, additional space up to 40,000 square metres would be accessible to people. Besides this, new sidewalks have been added in place of the red sand path, resulting in 94,600 metres of walkable pathways.

""As many as 422 new stone benches have been installed. With this, there will now be 16 bridges on the canals. Amenities like restrooms have been added which will be differently-abled friendly. Tourists will also have access to a step garden where people can come and sit, said Mr Puri.

In addition to new features, The Rajpath will now have underground stormwater drainage and a micro-irrigation sprinkler system to deal will puddles and waterlogging.

The parking facility has been increased and would now be able to house 50 buses and 1,000 vehicles at the same time. The Avenue will now have four underpasses -- 150 metres in length, at the Janpath - Rajpath crossing and C-Hexagon.

A new metro loop corridor, spanning about 3 km, has been proposed in the heart of the national capital to cater to people who will be visiting the new government buildings coming up as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, officials said on Monday.

The new circular line will have four metro stations and it will be built separately from the existing metro corridors -- Yellow Line and Violet Line -- passing through the area, they said.

The existing Central Secretariat station is an interchange facility between the Yellow Line and Violet Line.

The foundation stone of the Central Vista project was laid in December 2020. The infrastructural revamp envisages a new triangular Parliament building and a common Central Secretariat. The Central Vista redevelopment project also seeks to upgrade the boulevard running from Vijay Chowk to India Gate with more amenities.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Monday ""signed a memorandum of understanding, as per which DMRC shall provide technical assistance as well as execute finishing and services works for the construction of a metro loop corridor"" to connect the existing metro network with the new central secretariat buildings, which shall come up as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, the Delhi Metro stated.

A metro loop corridor, connecting ""four common Central Secretariat stations"" with the existing Central Secretariat metro station is being proposed to cater to the office-goers who shall travel to these offices using the metro. Planning is being done expecting a peak hour demand of 20,000 passengers per hour during the morning and evening peak hours. The entire corridor shall be underground, it said in a statement.

As per the MoU, the DMRC shall prepare the detailed project report apart from finalising the horizontal and vertical alignment of the tracks and tunnels along with sizing of facilities like platforms, support services and maintenance facilities. DMRC shall also appoint a detailed design consultant for the project, officials said.

""While CPWD will carry out the basic civil structure construction work, DMRC shall execute all other finishing and services works including design and construction of control systems, signal systems, track work, rolling stock, electrical and maintenance works etc.,"" the statement said.

Presently, DMRC is operating a metro network of about 391 km with 286 metro stations. As part of its fourth phase of expansion, DMRC is engaged in the construction of 65 km of new lines across three different corridors.

The MoU was signed at Metro Bhawan between DMRC's director, business development, Pramit Kumar Garg and P S Chauhan, additional director general, CPWD in the presence of DMRC's managing director, Mangu Singh and other senior officials.

""We hold there are no infirmities in clearances given,"" the court said

New parliament building is centerpiece of  20,000-crore project

The construction of the new parliament complex near Delhi's India Gate can go ahead, the Supreme Court said today in response to petitions that challenged the Central Vista project in terms of permissions and clearances. ""We hold that there are no infirmities in clearances given, change in land use,"" a three-judge bench of the court said in a majority verdict.

The new parliament building is the centerpiece of the Rs 20,000-crore Central Vista project, which aims to build and refurbish the government buildings on part of the 4-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, located at the heart of the national capital.

The government had recently held the groundbreaking ceremony for the new parliament building, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But it had assured the court that no construction activity will be undertaken till the judgment was delivered.

The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna were hearing petitions that raised concerns over the permissions given -- including the No-Objection Certificate given by the Central Vista Committee and the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament building.

In his verdict, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who gave an alternative view, held the project was ""bad in law"" in terms of land use for two reasons. ""There is no intelligible disclosure of public participation and no prior approval of heritage conservation committee,"" the judge said.

""I have sent the issue to heritage conservation committee... we have not gone into the merits of matter,"" added the judge, who had agreed on the aspect of notice, award of consultancy and the order of the Urban commission.

The government had defended the project in court, arguing that the current British-era Parliament House, opened in 1927, had less space, no fire safety norms or was earthquake proof. It had also contended that all central ministries need to be in one place to improve the efficiency of the government.

The government had also argued that the Central Vista project is a policy decision and the court cannot strike down policy decisions unless they violate fundamental rights.

""It is a policy decision that all central ministries should be at one place and that place has to be one which has historical significance,"" the government had told the court.

Today, the court ordered the government to set up smog towers ""as an integral part of the Central Vista project and use environment friendly construction material.

The Central Vista redevelopment project would generate large-scale direct and indirect employment which could become an ""important fulcrum of economic revival"", Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri told Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

In his written reply to a question by All India Trinamool Congress MP Mala Roy, Puri said, ""In the current economic scenario, the project shall generate large number of direct and indirect employment which could be an important fulcrum for economic revival.""

Mr Puri said that the estimated cost for construction of new Parliament building is Rs 971 crore.

Estimated cost of other buildings and development and redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue will be worked out after finalisation of plans, Mr Puri said.

Explaining the rationale behind the need of the project, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that the existing Parliament House building was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927 and hence, the building is already 93 years old, adding that its facilities and amenities are ""highly inadequate"".

""There is acute shortage of office space and there are no individual chambers for Members of Parliament. This building was not meant to be for bicameral Parliament and has been over-stressed through large scale retrofitting done over the years,"" the minister said.

He said that the other buildings such as Krishi Bhawan and Udyog Bhawan were built on the Central Vista after independence.

""These buildings are more than 50 years old and there is a shortage of working space, parking, amenities and services in these buildings for efficient office atmosphere.""

""The spread of central government ministries and departments in different locations leads to inefficiency and the problems can be resolved by developing a Common Central Secretariat,"" the minister said.

He also said that the Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of New Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi.

It is used for the Republic Day Parade and various other functions which showcase the national capital to the world.

""However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking etc. The unorganised vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. Therefore, there is a need for the upgradation of the Central Vista,"" Mr Puri added.

The minister also said that the consultancy work for Central Vista redevelopment project has been awarded to HCP Design Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd. through a quality-cum-cost based (QCBS) tendering system followed by the Central Public Works Department.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra today questioned the expenditure of Rs 20,000 crore on the Central Vista project amid the pandemic when it could have been used to procure as many as 62 crore vaccine doses and upgrade medical infrastructure.

She made the point at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's highest decision-making body, where the centre came in for strong criticism for its handling of the pandemic.

She later posted on Twitter:

PM's new residence & Central vista cost

= Rs 20,000 cr

= 22 crore Remdesvir vials

= 3 crore 10 litre oxygen cylinders

= 13 AIIMS with a total of 12,000 beds



WHY?  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) May 10, 2021

The Congress leader has repeatedly criticised the government for going ahead with the Central Vista project at a time when a surge in Covid cases has left people scrambling for hospital beds and medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders.

In a tweet posted last week, she had said, ""At a time when the people of the country are struggling with shortage of oxygen, vaccines, hospital beds, medicines, it would be better if the government deploys all resources in saving the lives of the people, instead of building a new house for the PM at Rs 13,000 crore.""

At the CWC meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi targeted the government for pursuing the grand project instead of providing free vaccination to all.

""Every expert has said that it would have made more sense and it would have been financially more equitable for the Centre to bear the costs. But we know (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi government has other priorities, pursuing grandiose projects against the force of public opinion and the face of widespread criticism.""

The remarks came at a time when the pandemic situation in the country has worsened and people have been left scrambling for medical equipment and hospital beds.

India has reported 4,12,262 new cases and 3,980 deaths over the past 24 hours.

As part of the Central Vista project, a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice-President are to come up. The 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate is also set to be revamped under the plan.

The Congress has been asking the government to halt the Central Vista plan and prioritise upgrading medical infrastructure to tackle the pandemic situation.

The opposition party has also criticised the government for categorising the project as ""essential services"".

Work on the project has continued despite the lockdown in the national capital that has brought most construction to a halt.

In a related development, the Supreme Court today refused to entertain a plea against deferment of hearing on a PIL seeking direction to halt construction under the project. The court, however, gave liberty to petitioners to approach the Delhi High Court for urgent listing of the matter.

The court was hearing the appeal against the May 4 order of the high court which had listed the PIL for hearing on May 17, saying it wants to first go through what the Supreme Court has deliberated in its judgment of January 5, giving a go-ahead to the project.

The court today asked senior advocate Siddharth Luthra to mention the matter before the High Court for urgent listing on May 10.

Delhi's three iconic buildings - the National Museum, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), the National Archives Annexe - emblematic of its history and culture are set to be demolished as part of the centre's Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project that envisages a new parliament building, and new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President.



The other buildings marked for demolition are: Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, Vice President's Residence, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan. The total area to be demolished is 4,58,820 square metres.



The National Museum has thousands of invaluable rare idols, original sculptures, priceless coins, paintings and jewellery that connect several points of political and cultural history. These include the famous dancing girl of Harappa, Nataraja in Chola Bronze, relics of Buddha, Ganjifa cards, Tanjore paintings and wood carved doors. All these objects will be shifted to North or South Block.



While the main building of the National Archives will remain intact, the annexe building will be demolished and a new building will be constructed.



The archival records kept here include 45 lakh files, 25,000 rare manuscripts, more than 1 lakh maps and 1.3 lakh Mughal documents. The transferring of documents is fraught with risk of loss or mishandling.



The Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts has an extravagant collection of heritage pieces, manuscripts and an impressive library. All of this will be temporarily shifted to the Janpath Hotel, which has been renovated for the purpose.



Last week, in an open letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a group of over 70 public intellectuals and scholars from India and abroad, including historian Romila Thapar, critic and scholar Gayatri Spivak and Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk, called for a halt and reconsideration of the government's Central Vista redevelopment project, and said: ""It is especially troubling that this extravagant project is moving ahead in the midst of a devastating pandemic. The current escalating health crisis calls for a pause and a reset. In the short term, all priorities and resources should be directed at combating the pandemic. In the long term, there should be public consultations so that the future of India's institutions, heritage architecture, and historical collections can be determined through a democratic process...The details of the Central Vista demolition are opaque. It is unclear, for example, how the National Museum art objects will be stored and eventually displayed.""



Earlier this year in February, the centre told the Lok Sabha that all listed Heritage buildings, precincts in the Central Vista region will be protected and any renovation work will be taken up after approval of Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC); architects, however, question these claims.



AG Krishna Menon, who is an architect, urban planner and conservation consultant, said, ""It is wrong from a town planning point of view that the original intent of the capital is being changed. The government claims that it is still conserving the heritage. Again, it is wrong because it is conserving a few buildings and that also the skeletons of the buildings. So in other words, what they're doing is the heritage is being conserved by conserving the building but hollowing out its meaning.""

Official sources said that there is ""no question of dropping"" the proposed new Prime Minister's Office (PMO) from the Central Vista Redevelopment project, after the CPWD did not mention the same in its new proposal before an expert panel of the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

The Central Vista Redevelopment project also includes the new Vice President''s Enclave which will be built on 15-acre land and will have five-storey buildings with a maximum height of 15 metres, the CPWD said in its proposal.

The VP Enclave will have 32 buildings.

Reacting to the CPWD's move to drop the proposed new Prime Minister''s Office in its latest proposal, Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said that the documents submitted to the Environment Ministry do not give any justification on why some plots or offices have been excluded or why the costs have increased despite such exclusions.

""But equally important is the CPWD's answer to whether any alternatives to the present proposal were considered is a ""No"". The study of such alternatives is required to be done before seeking environment clearance,"" Kohli said.

The CPWD's proposal for terms of reference, which is a step before the environment clearance, was discussed by the Environment Ministry expert appraisal committee (EAC) on Thursday.

The EAC had approved the CPWD's proposal to construct a new Parliament Building earlier this year.

""The project complies with Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and each and every condition which is put to ensure that it does not cause any pollution,"" the Centre told the court.

The Supreme Court had earlier sought the Centre's response in the matter after a petition was filed before it.

Lawyer Vikas Singh, appearing for Petitioner Aditya Dubey, had informed the Court that while construction work at small projects has been stopped for the sake of right to life, which includes the right to clean air and environment of the residents of Delhi and the National Capital Region, ""the construction of the massive Central Vista is being carried on at full swing right under the nose of the Supreme Court.""

""Is Central Vista work more important than the lives of crores of residents of Delhi and NCR?"" the petitioner asked.

The Centre has said that the government has taken all measures such as the use of anti-smog guns, mist spray system, use of dust suppressant like magnesium chloride, use of conveyor belt to transfer construction material, keeping all construction material in wet condition etc.

A three-judge special bench led by the Chief Justice of India will hear the matter tomorrow.

The Supreme Court had reimposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi on November 24 after taking note of air quality. Non-polluting activities relating to construction like plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work, and carpentry were allowed to be continued.

The Delhi government on November 27 deposited Rs 5,000 each in the bank accounts of 2.95 lakh construction workers who have been affected by the ban. Delhi has 6 lakh registered construction workers, and another one lakh are in the process of getting registered. Trade unions have however protested the move claiming the number of registered construction workers is a fraction of the real number of workers engaged in the activity in the state.

Senior spokesperson of the party Anand Sharma said, ""We are living in strange times. No relief for the migrant labour, no Justice for India's farmers fighting for their rights in bitter cold, pouring rain, tear gas and braving lathis. As we approach ""Ganatantra Diwas"" need to reflect on state of Republic.""

Mr Surjewala said it is ironical that in the times of a pandemic and an economic recession, the authorities in Delhi have Rs 14,000 crore for the Central Vista project and Rs 8,000 crore for buying aircraft for the prime minister.

""But the same BJP Government imposes cuts of Rs 37,530 Crore in allowances of 113 Lakh Armed Forces and Central Government employees and pensioners.

""PM must not forget that he has imposed cuts of Rs 11,000 Crore on 15 lakh soldiers and 26 lakh military pensioners,"" he said.

""And the same BJP Government at the Centre has no time to provide ""heated tents and equipment"" to our soldiers braving brazen Chinese incursions in Ladakh,"" the Congress leader said in a series of tweets.

Anand Sharma said, ""Saddened by Supreme court endorsement of Government's misplaced priorities during the Pandemic and clearing the Central vista project - an unnecessary and colossal waste of public money.""

""Grand building of brick and mortar do not strengthen Parliamentary democracy but only a healthy functioning parliament that upholds the Constitution and defends citizen's rights,"" the deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha said.

Another Congress spokesperson, Jaiveer Shergill, said, ""Hope Hon'ble Supreme Court along with giving green signal for New Parliament would have passed orders to ensure BJP follows norms of Parliamentary Democracy including holding of session to discuss laws, respect sanctity of Parliamentary committees & giving space to opposition.""

The Delhi State Environment Impact Assessment Authority has granted environmental clearance to the proposal for the construction of the 'Executive Enclave' which will house the new Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Secretariat.

The Delhi State Expert Appraisal Committee had last week recommended the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority to give green nod to the project.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority discussed the project at a meeting on Wednesday and approved it.

The Forest Department had on August 23 granted permission to the Central Public Works Department, the user agency, to transplant 487 of the 807 trees at the site under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.

During the meeting, the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority noted that the project will lead to the removal of 60 percent of the trees at the site.

""SEAC/SEIAA tried to get the PP (project proponent) to reduce felling of trees but only a few could be saved.

""The project design was presented as fait accompli (something that's already done). No attempt was made to make any major change in the footprint of the building that would have led to tree preservation on the site,"" it said.

Central Public Works Department or CPWD officials said the proposal was submitted for environmental clearance in December last year.

The State Expert Appraisal Committee, which vets the proposals before they are sent to SEIAA for clearance, had earlier this month set up a sub-committee to examine the implementation of the Delhi government's policy for tree transplantation and review the site plan ""in order to retain trees.""

Under the policy notified by the government in December 2020, agencies concerned are required to transplant a minimum of 80 per cent of the trees affected by their development works.

The benchmark tree survival rate at the end of one year of tree transplantation is 80 per cent.

The sub-committee in its report said the tree survey was not carried out at the time of project feasibility assessment and site identification.

The State Expert Appraisal Committee, which first examined the proposal in a meeting on January 31, had raised concern over the CPWD's plan to remove an ""excessively high proportion"" of trees from the site.

The CPWD later revised the proposal, decreasing the number of trees to be transplanted from 630 to 487 and increasing the number of trees to be retained at the site from 154 to 320.

In a meeting held on April 9, the State Expert Appraisal Committee decided to recommend the revised proposal to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority for grant of environmental clearance.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, however, referred the matter back to the State Expert Appraisal Committee to ensure that provisions of the tree transplantation policy are complied with.

According to the revised proposal for the Rs 1,381-crore project, the CPWD will maintain 1,022 trees at the site, so as to have a tree every 80 square metre of plot area as per the guidelines of the Union environment ministry.

A total of five buildings with a built-up area of 90,000 square metres will be constructed at the site after demolishing the built-up area of 47,000 sqm.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, envisages a new Parliament building, common Central Secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new office and residence of the Prime Minister, and a new Vice President enclave.

The redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Delhi, will be completed within two-and-a-half months, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday.

According to the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the central avenue project of the Central Vista will be ready in time to host the Republic Day parade in 2022.

Mr Puri asserted that the Winter session of Parliament next year will take place in the new Parliament building.

He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of two new multi-storey office complexes at Delhi's Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue for over 7,000 employees of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated these two new buildings earlier in the day.

""I would like to give you (PM) assurance that the redevelopment work of Central Vista Avenue will be completed in two-and-a-half months, where the Republic Day parade will be held (next year),"" Mr Puri said.

Talking about the two new office complexes for the employees of the Defence Ministry, the minister said the construction work of these buildings has been completed in just 12 months.

The project has generated over 6.4 lakh person days' of employment.

He said that light gauge steel framing (LGSF) technology has been used in constructing these two new office buildings.

""Under LGSF technology, there should be a minimum 24 months of time period for such buildings, but it has been reduced to 12 months,"" he said, adding that 8,782 metric tonnes of steel and 7,920 metric tonnes of cement have been used in the construction work.

Infrastructure firm Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited has been executing the redevelopment project of Central Vista Avenue stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate.

In a written communication to field units of CPWD in Delhi-NCR, Mr Sharma said the Central Vista division is in possession of around 600 cement concrete bollards of 90 cm height and they are lying near India Gate.

""These bollards are in good condition and can be utilised around lawns/parking areas in any government campus. If any office of CPWD desires to utilise these bollards in any of the area under its jurisdiction, he can contact the undersigned through email/phone within the next 10 days,"" he said.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would hear on July 17 the pleas which have raised issues regarding the Central Vista project, covering three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi.

A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar was hearing the pleas, including the one filed against the Delhi High Court order which said Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project.

The top court had said on June 19 that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the central government project would be ""at their own risk"".

The top court had made it clear that fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, would depend on its decision.

The court was earlier told that two notifications have been issued - one regarding land use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had told the top court that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The two petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.

The Supreme Court today refused to hear a petition for stopping construction work on the Central Vista plan at Rajpath and India Gate in the heart of Delhi.

The Supreme Court said the case is pending before the Delhi High Court and asked the petitioner to request the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court for an early hearing.

The Centre had objected to the request by petitioner Anya Malhotra.

Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioner, argued that Covid will peak in May and there is a 30 per cent increase in cases from April. Construction work at a 3.5 km-stretch around India Gate should be suspended in the circumstances, he said.

But the Centre objected, saying the High Court had adjourned the case to May 17 and had yet to hear it.

Mr Luthra argued that it was a humanitarian crisis and workers were exposed to infection.

""You (petitioner) can request the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court for an early hearing. You have come here against the adjournment of the case,"" the Supreme Court said.

""We are of the opinion that since the matter is pending before the High Court that had only adjourned the case, the petitioner should request the Chief Justice of the High Court for an early hearing,"" Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari said.

The petition, which asks that the Central Vista redevelopment project be suspended due to Covid, was moved before the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court adjourned the case to May 17.

The construction is ""not advisable"" in the current situation of Covid in Delhi and will be a super-spreader, the petition says.

It also argues that it is not overreaching the Supreme Court verdict last year allowing the plan to proceed but only wants temporary suspension of construction activity, given the present health crisis in Delhi.

Construction work near India Gate has not stopped even though Delhi has been in lockdown for nearly three weeks. Construction work is permitted at construction sites where workers are living on-site. But NDTV found many workers travelling to the site daily from other parts of Delhi.

The grand makeover plan recently received an environmental go-ahead and a deadline has been set for a new home for the Prime Minister as part of the plan -- December 2022.

The Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has been allocated Rs 2,600 crore in Budget 2022-23 for the construction of non-residential office buildings of the Central Vista project, including the Parliament and Supreme Court. This is Rs 767.56 crore more than Rs 1,833.43 crore given in the last fiscal.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-kilometre Rajpath boulevard that stretches from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and a new Prime Minister's Office as well as a new Vice President's Enclave.

A sum of Rs 2,600.99 has been been allocated for the construction of non-residential office buildings, including the Parliament and Supreme Court of India. For residential purposes, the ministry has been given Rs 873.02 crore.

Six infrastructure firms, including Tata Projects Limited, L&T Limited and Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited, are in the race to win the contract to construct the Executive Enclave, which will house the new PMO, Cabinet Secretariat, India House and National Security Council Secretariat.

According to the proposed plan, the Executive Enclave will come up on the south side of the South Block in plot number 36/38 in the high-security zone in Lutyens' Delhi.

Last year, Larsen & Toubro Limited had been awarded the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three buildings of the Common Central Secretariat.

Tata Projects Limited is constructing a new parliament building while Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue stretching from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

In November last year, Jharkhand-based infrastructure firm Kamladityya Construction Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for constructing a Vice-President's Enclave.

An iconic structure on the last stretch of the Central Vista project should be built by August 2022 to commemorate the 75th year of Independence, the government said today while announcing a design competition, timeline and site location for the multi-crore project. The ""Nav Bharat Udyan"" will be the last part of the Central Vista project, the India Gate to the Yamuna stretch of the axis that begins from the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

The Rs 20,000-crore Central Vista project seeks to build a new parliament and other central government offices in the 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. The project will be aligned along the two sides of the Rajpath and form the seat of the government that will start with the North Block. After it, on the banks of Yamuna, will be the Nav Bharat Udyan with its iconic structure.

""Spread over 20.22 acres, Nav Bharat Udyan will be open to the public and is being designed to have an iconic structure and infotainment facilities such as Sphere of Unity, Milestones Walkway, Journey of India, Tech Dome, Amphitheatre, public amenities etc. to showcase India's rich historical and cultural heritage, scientific achievements, and will symbolize unity in diversity and aspirations of the New India,"" a government statement read.

The iconic structure can be a tower or a sculpture ""or any other built form but not a building to be occupied"", the government said.

A design competition will be held from November 12 to ""crowd-source implementable ideas for the conceptual architectural and structural design of the iconic structure"", the government said.

The results of the competition, which will have a first prize of Rs 5 lakh, will be announced in the last week of December.

The iconic design will be ""timeless"", ""aspirational"", ""indigenous"", ""implementable"" and ""commemorative"", the government said. Its location will be on the banks of Yamuna and aligned with the India Gate.

The Supreme Court has declined to stay the project despite environmental and other concerns.

In October last year, the government had said that there will be no external changes to the iconic Raisina Hill complex and the parliament building.

The Central Vista stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate required to host the Republic Day Parade will be ready in time, but some facilities will be completed later, according to the project's architectural consultant.

An official of the HCP Design, Planning and Management also said that arrangements have already begun for hosting the Republic Day Parade on the newly-developed Rajpath.

On December 2, the government had told Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question that the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue, which has a deadline of December this year, has achieved 60 per cent of physical progress. The HCP design official told PTI on Wednesday, ""The stretch of Central Vista Avenue required for the Republic Day Parade will be ready in time. Some facilities are to be completed later."" Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate.

Under the project, new trees would come up while parking spaces, vending areas and other facilities are being created.

The official also said that the work design of the new vice president's enclave and executive enclave housing the Prime Minister's Office is underway.

Earlier this month, the government had said that the new parliament building project, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2022, has achieved 35 per cent of physical progress.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-kilometre-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, a new prime minister's residence and prime minister's office, and a new vice president's enclave.

At the inaugural ceremony of two office complexes for the employees of the Defence Ministry and the armed forces here on September 16, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the Winter Session of Parliament next year would take place in the new parliament building.

Addressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event, he had said, 'I would like to assure you that the redevelopment work of Central Vista Avenue will be completed in two-and-a-half months, where the Republic Day parade will be held.' Last month, infrastructure firm Kamladityya Construction Pvt Ltd had won the bid to construct the vice president enclave.

The whole area has been re-named Kartavya Path (Path of Duty) in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to shed names and symbols reminiscent of the British era.

The entire road and area from the Netaji statue to the Rashtrapati Bhavan will be known as Kartavya Path -- a reminder of the Prime Minister's emphasis of duty in the run-up to 2047, when India marks 100 years of Independence.

During his address from the ramparts of Red Fort on August 15, PM Modi had stressed on the abolition of symbols relating to colonial mindset. In line with it, the Navy changed its ensign last week, during the launch of the country's first homemade aircraft carrier INS Vikrant.

Earlier, the name of the road on which PM's residence is located was changed from Race Course Road to Lok Kalyan Marg.

Sources said on September 7, the NDMC has convened a special meeting for the renaming. This was meant to be a ""message to the ruling class that the era of rulers and subjects is over"", sources said.

The new-look Rajpath will be opened to the public next week after a 20-month gap.

Considered the most popular public space in the city, the stretch has been redeveloped with red granite walkways spread around 1.1 lakh square metre with greenery all around.

There are more than 133 lamp posts along the Rajpath, 4,087 trees, 114 modern signages and stepped gardens.

The Central Vista Avenue has been revamped with dedicated vending zones where not only the staple ice-cream, but food from 16 states will be available. There will also be new blocks for public amenities and parking zones for more than 1000 cars.

This is the first phase that has been completed under the ambitious redevelopment plan of the Central Vista, which will be the nation's power corridor.

The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that the Central Vista project, covering three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens' Delhi, would ""save money"" which is paid as rent for housing Central government ministries in the national capital.

It submitted that the decision to have a new parliament building has not been taken in a haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.

The Centre said new parliament building is needed as numerous occupants have indicated the inadequacies in the existing one.

Opposing the petitions which have raised questions over several aspects including the environmental clearance (EC) granted to the project, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that having all the ministries at one place would increase the efficiency and ensure better coordination between them.

The law officer submitted before the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, that the structure of existing parliament building is not earthquake proof and the new parliament building would supplement the existing one.

""Even after 73 year of independence, the nation does not have a central secretariat. Various ministries have hired premises on rent. Thousands of crores in rent is paid for housing central government ministries. This project saves money,"" the solicitor general said.

The Supreme Court today said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project, covering the 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in New Delhi, will be ""at their own risk"".

The Supreme Court made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.

The top court was hearing a plea against the Delhi High Court order which said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project of the central government.

""Any change at the ground level will be at their own risk,"" said a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.

The vehement plea of the petitioner that the ground situation at the site should not be changed as there are several monuments of national heritage which may allegedly be removed, did not cut much ice with the court which observed that the project will not be completed within a week.

The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, was informed by the petitioner that two notifications have been issued - one regarding land use change and the other giving environmental clearance to the project.

""We have already said, whatever step are taken, it is on their risk,"" the bench observed.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that no norms have been violated in granting the requisite approval for the project.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on July 7, allowed the petitioner to amend his plea to challenge the recent decisions taken by the authority for the project.

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, argued that till the next date of hearing no clearance should be granted as all those clearances will also be challenged.

The bench asked the petitioner to file his compilation by June 23 and directed the Centre to file its response by July 3.

The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The high court's stay order on the single judge bench's February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.

The two petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The environment ministry's expert appraisal committee has recommended granting environment clearance to the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, but directed that its developer should ensure no air pollution is caused during the demolition of existing structures.

With the expert panel's recommendations, the project comes a step closer to getting the environment clearance (EC), to be given by the Union Environment Minister.

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) took the decision in a meeting held on December 17, the minutes of which were uploaded on the ministry's website on Monday.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is executing the project which includes development/redevelopment of Common Central Secretariat Buildings and Central Conference Centre, along with Prime Minister's Residence, SPG Building and Vice President's Enclave. It has revised the estimated project cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

According to the minutes of the EAC meeting, the CPWD said that it will cover the impact of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report for holistic coverage of overall impacts, which means a new PMO will also come up under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

In its earlier proposal, the CPWD had not mentioned the construction of a new PMO. It had written a letter to the expert panel recently, saying that the impact of the proposed PMO will be included in the EIA report.

The expert panel said that it has deliberated upon the information provided by the CPWD and found that ""the project is now integrated in nature. After detailed deliberation, EAC recommended granting Terms of Reference.""

While granting Terms of Reference (ToR), the panel asked the developer to provide ""detailed demolition plan along with mitigative measures, include details of proposed strategy for management of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and efforts must be made for instant demolition of latest technique in place of extended demolition to avoid air pollution during demolition process.""

With the ToR having been granted, the CPWD now has the go-ahead to draw up the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environment Management Plan (EMP) reports and submit it to the environment ministry for final approval.

A savage second wave of Covid across the country and the huge oxygen shortage have not affected a Rs 1,500-crore project at the heart of Delhi. The Central Vista, with a brand new parliament building as its centrepiece, appeared well on its way despite the second week of lockdown that has brought most construction sites to a grinding halt. The construction work has been brought under the ambit of ""essential services"" -- a move that has irked the opposition.

Technically, construction work is permitted on construction sites where workers have been given on-site accommodation. But when NDTV did a spot check at the location, not many were found camping at the construction site.

Most of the workers were found coming from Kirti Nagar -- 16 km away -- and adjoining areas.

One of the labourers from Bengal, who works at the site, said they are ferried to work by a special bus to ensure that the prestigious project close to the heart of Prime Minister Narendra Modi can meet its deadline.

The Central Vista project -- which aims to build and refurbish the government buildings on part of the 4-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate -- is expected to be completed before the general elections in 2023.

The labourers are working a 12-hour shift at the rate of Rs 600 per day.

The project -- being built to commemorate 75 years of Independence -- has come under considerable scrutiny from many, especially the opposition, for continuing unabated as the country faces what the Supreme Court called a ""national emergency"".

Congress's Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly urged the Centre to spend money on vaccines, oxygen and other health services instead of ""unnecessary projects"".

""This must be stopped. It is not correct that this vanity project carries on,"" RJD's Manoj Jha has said.

But there is no stopping the project, especially after a go-ahead from the Supreme Court in January. The court had swept aside petitions that challenged the construction at the heart of Delhi -- over an area equal to 50 football fields  saying there are ""no infirmities in clearances given, change in land use"".

The engineers, contractors and labourers admit to a migration of workers when the Covid surge started in March. For those who remain, it has not been possible to maintain the social distancing norms, they said.

The government has already floated tenders to the tune of nearly 3,500 cr for the construction of government buildings in the area.

The NDA government had embarked on the project contending that the current Parliament House, opened in 1927, is ill equipped to meet the modern day needs. It has had less space, no fire safety norms or was earthquake proof. It had also contended that all central ministries need to be in one place to improve the efficiency of the government.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will today inaugurate the newly-named Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath) - a stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate that will have red granite walkways with greenery all around, refurbished canals, state-wise food stalls, new amenity blocks and vending kiosks.

According to the government, it symbolises a shift from erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment.

PM Modi will also unveil a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate. These steps are in line with the Prime Minister's second 'Panch Pran' for New India in Amrit Kaal: 'remove any trace of colonial mindset', it said.

The traffic police has made arrangements to ensure smooth vehicular movement in central Delhi where restrictions have been imposed for the event. General traffic movement will be diverted from specific roads from 6 pm to 9 pm, officials said.

The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has replaced the erstwhile Rajpath signages with new signboards of 'Kartavya Path'. On Wednesday, the NDMC had approved a proposal to rename Rajpath as 'Kartavya Path'.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited has executed the redevelopment of the entire stretch from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. The project was tendered at Rs 477 crore.

The CPWD has set up five vending zones where 40 vendors each will be allowed and two blocks near the India Gate with eight shops each. Some states have shown their interest to set up their food stalls.

The entire stretch has been revamped under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said over the years, Rajpath (now Kartavya Path) and adjoining areas of the Central Vista Avenue had been witnessing pressure of increasing traffic of visitors, putting stress on its infrastructure.

It lacked basic amenities like public toilets, drinking water, street furniture and adequate parking space. Further, there was inadequate signage, poor maintenance of water features and haphazard parking.

Also, a need was felt to organise the Republic Day parade and other national events in a less disruptive manner with minimal restrictions on public movement.

""The redevelopment has been done bearing these concerns in mind while also ensuring the integrity and continuity of architectural character,"" the statement said.

'Kartavya Path' will exhibit beautified landscapes, lawns with walkways, added green spaces, refurbished canals, new amenity blocks, improved signages and vending kiosks.

Further, new pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting are some other features that will enhance the public experience.

An official in the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said there would be heavy deployment of police personnel and security guards to ensure that there is no theft and damage to newly-installed facilities. Around 80 security guards will keep an eye on the stretch.

The official said that 19 acres of total canal area have been revamped. They have been fitted with infrastructure such as aerators. There are 16 bridges on the entire stretch. Boating will be allowed in two canals -- one near Krishi Bhawan and another around Vanijya Bhawan.

The official said maintaining cleanliness will be a challenge as people in a large number will throng the Rajpath, which is considered as the most popular public space in the city.

""We appealed to people to maintain cleanliness. Large teams of sanitation workers will be deployed,"" the official said.

Along the Rajpath, the area spreading 3.90 lakh square metre has been developed with greenery all around. Also, the new red granite walkways spreading 15.5 km have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier.

Another official said that parking space for 1,125 vehicles have been created in the entire stretch. A parking space for 35 buses has been created near the India Gate.

Seventy-four historic light poles and all chain links have been restored. Over 900 new light poles have been installed. Concrete bollards have been replaced with over 1,000 white sandstone bollards to maintain the precinct's character.

According to the ministry, over 400 benches, 150 dustbins and more than 650 new signages have been installed on the entire stretch.

One hundred and one acres of lawns have been replanted with different species of grass, appropriate to their location. Proper slopes and drain channels have been integrated to minimise damage caused by the stagnation of water.

Four new pedestrian underpasses have been built at busy junctions to segregate vehicular traffic from pedestrian movement, making the street safe to cross.

The ministry said the tall amenity blocks and underpasses have ramps with railings at suitable heights for safe use by children and the specially-abled.

It said that arrangements for the Republic Day Parade have been standardised and integrated.

""Modular bleachers have been proposed for the Republic Day seating arrangements, saving time and effort in setting-up and dismantling, and reducing damage to the lawns,"" it also said.

The light poles are fitted with necessary technology and services for the annual Republic Day Parade, connected to the newly laid underground service lines, it added.

The Environment Ministry's Regional Empowered Committee (REC) has ""in-principle"" approved a proposal for diversion of 8.11 hectares of ""deemed forest"" land, where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) stood, for the construction of three office buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The final approval for diversion of forest land is to be granted by the central government.

In August, the Delhi government had recommended the proposal for approval of the REC ""in larger public interest subject to the conditions laid by the forest department"".

There are more than 250 trees per hectare at the site. Therefore, it was treated as ""deemed forest"" and required approval for diversion for non-forest activity under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, a Delhi forest department official said.

Of the existing 2,219 trees at the site, the Central Public Works Department seeks to transplant 1,734 and retain 485 trees.

The three office buildings, which will be part of the Common Central Secretariat, are to be built at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore, with Rs 139 crore set aside for five years' maintenance.

The REC approved the CPWD's proposal in a meeting held on August 24 subject to certain conditions.

It said the land for compensatory afforestation should be made available to the Delhi Forest Department, free of all encroachment and encumbrances, within 15 days of the approval and compliance submitted to the Integrated Region Office, Jaipur.

""Translocation scheme needs to be submitted before IRO, Jaipur as per species and age classes suitable for translocation. Forest land will be handed over only after required non-forest land for the project is handed over by the user agency,"" the minutes of the meeting read.

The CPWD has informed the Delhi Forest department that it will transplant 1,500 trees at NTPC Eco Park, Badarpur. The location for the remaining trees is being finalised.

According to the agency, there are 1,179 trees, including the 485 retained ones, in the proposed ""landscape plan"" of the project. The CPWD has proposed 8.11 hectares of land near Dhulsiras village in Sector 29, Dwarka for compensatory afforestation.

During an inspection conducted in July, the forest department found the land suitable for CA, according to documents seen by PTI.

However, compensatory afforestation can only be done after pruning of ""invasive species of trees on 20 percent of the proposed land"", the forest department has told the CPWD.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 requires that afforestation is carried out in compensation for forest land diverted for non-forestry uses.

Compensatory afforestation can be done over an equivalent area of non-forest land or over degraded forest twice in extent of the area being diverted, if non-forest land is not available. According to the ministry's guidelines, at least 1,000 saplings per hectare have to be planted on the identified non-forest land.

""Therefore, 8,110 saplings will be planted at the site in Dwarka,"" a forest department official said.

The CPWD will be allowed to start work at the IGNCA site only after it deposits Rs 7.07 crore and hand over the required non-forest land to the forest department for plantation work, he said.

According to the CPWD, Central Vista houses only 22 of the 51 ministries of the central government. In some cases, a ministry has offices split between different buildings. This scattering of ministry offices across Delhi hampers the efficiency of administration and increases operation costs and energy usage.

Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri Tuesday said the record rainfall last week cost the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project ""a day or two, but not more"".

Last month, the project's architectural consultant had said that the Central Vista stretch from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate required to host the Republic Day Parade this year would be ready in time, but some facilities would be completed later.

Speaking at an online event Tuesday on the ministry's month-long programme to mark 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav', Mr Puri said the programme would 'hopefully' culminate at an event in Surat on February 4 and February 5.

According to the ministry, the dates for the main event -- 'Smart Cities, Smart Urbanization' -- are tentative, considering the emerging COVID-19 situation in the country. ""I use the word hopefully because we plan, but we got the highest amount of rainfall that any day in January has witnessed in the last many years and I think my Central Vista Avenue expansion programme has probably lost a day or two, but not more,"" Mr Puri said at the event.

On January 8, Delhi had recorded its highest rainfall in a day for January in over 20 years. On January 9, the national capital had received 5.4mm of rainfall, a day after 41mm rainfall had been recorded, taking the total precipitation in the city to 63.6mm --- the highest in January in 27 years.

In a statement, the HUA ministry said that the events under 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' (AKAM), started from January 1, are witnessing overwhelming response from citizens, public representatives, community organisations, industry, academia, knowledge partners and startups among others.

The celebrations reflect five themes of AKAM vis.  Freedom Struggle, Actions@75, Achievements@75, Ideas@75 and Resolve@75, the statement stated.

More than 3 lakh Indian citizens are expected to participate in MoHUA's AKAM celebrations.

Not a single MP in either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha had objected to the construction of a new parliament building when a request for it was made by both the Houses to the Centre, Speaker of the lower house, Om Birla, said on Friday.

Describing the new parliament building as a ""necessity"", he said though the construction is running 16 days behind schedule, it will be completed by October 2022.

""We were (initially) 27 days ahead of schedule. But after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (second wave), the construction is now 16 days behind schedule,"" Mr Birla said.

To questions on construction of a new parliament house at a press conference here, the Lok Sabha speaker said the existing building cannot be expanded and does not cater to the needs of changing times.

""The existing building is a historical one. Many historic decisions were taken in this building. But it cannot be expanded further and therefore a new building is a necessity,"" he said.

About MPs from opposition parties opposing the project, Birla said it was both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha which had requested the Central government for a new parliament building.

The new parliament building - the foundation stone for which was laid Thursday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - will be the highlight of the ambitious Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project that PM Modi said will become ""a symbol of a new and self-reliant India"".

To be built over 64,500 sq m, it will be located a stone's throw from Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. The four-storey building will be triangular and its interiors will have three national symbols - the lotus, the peacock and the banyan tree - as its themes.

The parliament building alone will cost an estimated Rs 971 crore and will, the government hopes, be ready before India's 75th Independence Day (in 2022). However, construction cannot yet begin as a legal challenge is pending in the Supreme Court.

To be constructed (when the top court gives the green light) by Tata Projects Ltd, the new parliament building will overlook the old - which was built nearly 100 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh and will be turned into a museum.

The new Parliament building is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.

The new Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls will have increased seating capacities (888 and 384 seats, respectively) in anticipation of an expanded Parliament; a 25-year-old freeze on increasing state-wise distribution of seats ends in 2026.

In addition, seating in the Lok Sabha hall can be expanded to 1,272 to host joint sessions.

Architect Bimal Patel said the triangular shape of the new parliament was a reference to ""sacred geometries in various religions and cultures of India"".

""In the Lok Sabha chamber, we have used the national bird (peacock) as the theme. In the Rajya Sabha we have used the national flower (lotus) and in the central lounge we have used the national tree (banyan),"" Mr Patel added.

The new Parliament building is being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd.

The national emblem will crown the new parliament, the ceiling of which will have fresco paintings (similar to those in Rashtrapati Bhawan) and carpets with traditional designs. Interior walls will have shlokas inscribed - to retain some of the characteristics of the existing parliament.

Dholpur stone will be the primary construction material (as it was with the current building) and red granite may replace red sandstone in some interior sections. Special care will be taken during construction to ensure minimal disturbance and environmental safeguards.

The new Parliament will be equipped with all modern audio-visual communication facilities.

The building will be equipped with modern audio-visual communication systems and will house committee rooms, offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, Lok Sabha Secretariat and Rajya Sabha Secretariats, as well as dining facilities and museums and exhibitions for the public.

A central Constitution Hall will showcase the history and heritage of the country.

Within the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls, special provisions will be made for smart displays and biometrics to make voting easier and safe.

The National Emblem will crown the new Parliament building.

The technological improvements will include language interpretation facilities and programmable microphones - which will give the Speaker more control in managing the House. Virtual sound simulations will help set the right levels of reverberation and limit echo and voice feedback.

PM Modi laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building today,

The central courtyard will include an open-air meeting space for MPs and also a cafe.

MPs' chambers will have VVIP access at subterranean levels, thereby freeing up ground floor access for government officials and members of the public. There will also be ceremonial entrances for the President, the Prime Minister, the Speakers of the two Houses and MPs.

The new parliament will also be fully wheelchair- and disabled-access friendly.

Highlights The Chhattisgarh government cancelled tenders for new assembly building

Construction in the ""Nava Raipur"" area has now been stopped immediately

The ""Bhoomi pujan"" for these projects was done last year

Bristling at accusations of doublespeak in its attack on the BJP government at the centre for spending crores on remodelling New Delhi's VIP zone in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, the Congress-led government in Chhattisgarh has put a similar project in the state on hold.

Announcing tougher measures to check the spread of COVID-19, the Chhattisgarh government on Thursday said it had cancelled tenders for the construction of the new assembly building and also stopped work on major projects in the state.

Construction of the new governor's house, assembly house, chief minister's house, residences of ministers and senior officers, new circuit house in the ""Nava Raipur"" area has now been stopped with immediate effect, a statement issued by the state government said.

The ""bhoomi pujan"" or groundbreaking ceremony for these projects was done last year.

""Our citizens - our priority. Foundation stone for the construction of new assembly building, Raj Bhavan, Chief Minister's residence, residences of ministers and senior officials, new circuit house was laid before start of Corona. Today, all these construction works have been stopped in these times of crisis,"" Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel tweeted in Hindi.

The announcement came two days after BJP chief JP Nadda wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi alleging ""consistent negativity"", duplicity and pettiness in her party's criticism of the government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Chhattisgarh government's projects were among the examples of hypocrisy that he cited after the opposition party hit out at the central government for carrying on the construction of the Central Vista project in Delhi that includes a new residence for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a new parliament.

The Congress was quick to seize Chief Minister Baghel's announcement and renew its attack on the central government for spending crores amid a shortage of vaccines, oxygen and other necessities, with senior Congress leader and MP Jairam Ramesh tweeting:

Dear PM @narendramodi



This how a responsive and responsible government works in a democracy. Chhattisgarh Govt is prioritising lives of its people above everything else and redoubling its efforts to fight COVID-19.

Among the worst-hit states in the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Chhattisgarh currently has 1.22 lakh active COVID-19 cases and has reported 11,094 deaths, according to the union health ministry.

Announcing its decision to halt the construction projects, the state government said it had ""instructed all departments on April 26 that, like the previous year, austerity should be exercised in the financial year 2021-22"".

""Now, even further, on the instructions of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, the major construction works in Nava Raipur have been stopped with immediate effect,"" its statement said.

The chief engineer of the Public Works Department has issued orders to contractors to stop construction work on these projects, it added.

It said that along with this, ""the previously issued tenders for the construction of -- Rs 245.16 crore and Rs 118 crore -- works for the construction of the new assembly building in Sector-19 have been cancelled with immediate effect"".

A request was made to the Delhi High Court on Monday to give an early hearing to a PIL seeking a stay on the construction of the Central Vista here amid the raging COVID pandemic.

The request was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh by senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, and the court said an early hearing application be filed first.

Mr Luthra told the bench that he was mentioning the matter as the Supreme Court on May 7 asked the petitioners to seek urgent hearing before the high court on May 10.

Petitioners -- Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker -- had moved the top court against the high court's May 4 order adjourning their plea to May 17.

The high court had adjourned the matter saying it first wants to study the top courts January 5 judgement giving a go ahead to the Central Vista project.

In the appeal before the Supreme Court, the petitioners had contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold for now during the pandemic.

In the hearing before the top court, Mr Luthra had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.

""Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,"" Mr Luthra had told the top court.

On Monday, he made the same argument before the high court while seeking an early hearing of the matter.

The application for early hearing is likely to be heard by the high court on Tuesday, May 11.

Mr Luthra had told the top court that when the nation was considering lockdown and even the Indian Premier League is being shut, the construction activity cannot be allowed.

The plea before the high court has contended that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.

It has also contended that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the ""crumbling"" healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.

The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, has said.

On September 14, the Telangana Assembly passed a resolution urging the Centre to name the new Parliament building after Ambedkar. The Bharatiya Janata Party was absent during the debate about the resolution.

The next day, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi-led government declared that the new secretariat in the centre of Hyderabad would be named after Ambedkar. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao added that he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to name the new Parliament building in Delhi 'Ambedkar Parliament'.

Telangana State Legislature has unanimously resolved that the new Parliament should be named after Bharat Ratna Dr. BR Ambedkar Ji



It is befitting to name the highest abode of democracy after the Chief Architect of Indian constitution



Hope that NDA Govt will respond positively  KTR (@KTRTRS) September 14, 2022

The demand is finding resonance among civil society groups too and has led to social media discussions as well as public mobilisation. But two questions arise:

Should a Parliament that makes laws for a nation over a long period of time be named after one leader, whatever be their stature and acceptability? Does Ambedkar deserve such a pedestal over all other founders and leaders of India's parliamentary democracy?

Usually, a parliament building should not be confined to the name of one individual, however great that individual was. Since Parliament represents the whole nation, it should be the 'Indian Parliament'.

However, it is a cultural practice in India to name all manner of things after noteworthy individuals. Logically, why not name the new parliament building after any great individual who contributed significantly enough to build parliamentary democracy in India?

I will soon write to the Prime Minister Sri @narendramodi Ji with a request to consider the demand of Telangana Govt. to name the new Parliament building after Dr. BR Ambedkar.: CM Sri KCR  Telangana CMO (@TelanganaCMO) September 15, 2022

The second question requires a comparative evaluation of three personalities who played a key role in institutionalising constitutional parliamentary democracy in India: Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. MK Gandhi had little to do with the making of the Constitution. Gandhi's role ended with India achieving freedom as he chose to remain outside the constituent assembly, which drafted the country's Constitution.

Of the three founders mentioned, the current ruling dispensation holds a hostile view of Nehru, his ideological, theoretical and administrative roles as freedom fighter and as the first prime minister of India. With Nehru as the father figure of the Gandhi-Nehru family that ruled for several years, Modi has positioned himself in direct confrontation with him.

The others that the Modi government may be positively inclined to view then are Ambedkar and Patel. This is evident from the past eight years of the Bharatiya Janata Party's rule.

Ambedkar and Patel have competing status, no doubt. Evaluating their struggle, theory, practice and the impact of their role on democratic principles and ideals makes them both serious contenders to name the new parliament building after. However, for philosophical and ideological reasons, rather than Patel, it is Ambedkar's name that should take precedence.

Patel, who hailed from a Shudra agrarian landed family, rose to become a towering freedom fighter, activist, leader and administrator. He went on to unify the country with determination and strong will, persuading the rulers of the many princely states to merg with the Indian Union. Patel was a lawyer and had a successful practice in courts  but he was not a legal philosopher, historian or economist.

In the name of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Modi Govt will give the highest civilian award in the field of contribution to the unity and integrity of India.



The award will be announced on National Unity Day - the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel - on 31st October. pic.twitter.com/6YS4zvkscO  BJP (@BJP4India) September 26, 2019

Ambedkar, on the other hand, was from the most oppressed category of 'untouchables'. He was also a fighter, activist, leader and administrator in his own way. Additionally, Ambedkar was a profound legal and moral philosopher. He trained himself in several disciplines such as history, sociology and politics and economics.

He was a powerful speaker with a command over English, Hindi Marathi and also Sanskrit. He was also well-versed in multiple schools of thought  Buddhist, Vaidic, Jain, Islamic, Christian and more. At the same time he had a command over Euro-American history, philosophy and legal systems.

While steering the drafting of the Constitution and getting articles passed in the Constituent Assembly, his initiations and interventions surpassed those of the rest. Ambedkar's intellectual power convinced friend and foe in the Constituent Assembly that his conviction to establish a democratic system in India was unmatched.

Yet, as long as the Congress was in full control of the power structures in Delhi, Ambedkar was ignored. India began rdiscovering Ambedkar in the post-Mandal era  after the Mandal Commission report recommending affirmative reservation for backward classes in education and jobs was published in 1980.

From courts to universities and mass movements, Ambedkar's writings and speeches in the Constituent Assembly and outside became weapons to defend Indian democracy as it entered crisis after crisis. Indian democracy and Ambedkar almost became synonymous.

The Mandal era resurrected Ambedkar's commitment to India as a nation. Though Ambedkar knew that Western constitutional ideals evolved in many countries particularly, England and the United States, he drew more relevant principles from Indian history. Thus, Ambedkar made Indian nationalism more grounded than anybody else's. Buddha's parables, Mauryan emperor Ashoka's administrative principles and symbols were made relevant in modern times because of Ambedkar.

He often repeated the three cardinal principles of democracy  liberty, equality and fraternity  from ancient Indian history, not French thought. Ambedkar's nationalism was not rooted in mythology but in the productive life of the Indian masses. He helped bring from the margins the concerns of the historically oppressed into the constitutional framework.

The Dalits, Adivasis and shudras today owe to him their slowly but surely transforming lives. If the new parliament building is named after Ambedkar, it would be clear that a serious civilisational transformation is underway in India. The complete and true de-colonisation of India will set a new benchmark.

Minister KT Rama Rao, who moved the resolution on Ambedkar, lauded his contribution towards framing of the Constitution. He said that Telangana became a reality due to Article 3 of the Constitution that deals with formation of new states.

Telangana was carved out of the state of Andhra Pradesh on June 2, 2014.

Rao said that it is because of Ambedkar that India has been a democratic republic and there cannot be any better tribute to him than naming the new Parliament building after him, reported the Hindustan Times.

The Congress, which suggested moving the resolution, and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen backed the motion. It was passed unanimously by a voice vote.

On Tuesday, the resolution opposing the Electricity Amendment Bill was moved by Energy Minister G Jagadish Reddy, who said said the proposed legislation was detrimental to the interests of farmers, members of the poorer sections of society and employees of the power sector.

Reddy asked the Centre to withdraw the Bill, which was debated in the state Assembly on Monday.

The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 8 and referred for scrutiny to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy on the same day as Opposition parties criticsed the proposed law that seeks to amend The Electricity Act, 2003.

The Electricity Amendment Bill 2022 seeks to create competition in the power distribution sector by providing consumers options to choose between multiple service providers in an area. Opposition parties fear that the Bill could boost privatisation and create a threat to cooperative federalism.

They also had apprehend that the subsidies given to farmers for electricity would be snatched away.

1074, https://scroll.in/latest/1032396/pm-modi-unveils-subhas-chandra-bose-statue-to-inaugurate-kartavya-path ,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday inaugurated the newly-refurbished Kartavya Path and unveiled a statue of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate in New Delhi.

Kartavya Path  a stretch of the Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate  was formerly known as Rajpath. On Wednesday, Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi announced the name change. She said that the name Rajpath reflected a 'colonial mindset' as it conveys the idea of 'raj', or rule.

The revamped road now has new pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels and upgraded night lighting, a press release from the prime minister's office said. There will also be lawns with walkways, added green spaces and refurbished canals along the street, the Union government said.

The central public works department has set up five designated zones where 40 vendors each will be allowed, PTI reported. Two blocks have also been set up near the India Gate, where eight shops will be set up.

The prime minister's office said that the name change 'symbolises a shift from erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment'. In colonial times, Rajpath was known as Kingsway.

Meanwhile, Modi on Thursday unveiled the statue of Bose at the same place near India Gate where a hologram statue of the freedom fighter had been inaugurated on January 23 this year. The statue, carved from a monolithic granite stone, is 28 feet tall and weighs 65 megatonnes. Its main sculptor is Arun Yogiraj, the prime minister's office said.

'The statue, made of granite, is a fitting tribute to the immense contribution of Netaji to our freedom struggle, and would be a symbol of the country's indebtedness to him,' a press release said.","Narendra Modi inaugurates Kartavya Path, unveils Subhas Chandra Bose statue in Delhi",9,2022

This morning, I had the honour of unveiling the National Emblem cast on the roof of the new Parliament. pic.twitter.com/T49dOLRRg1  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 11, 2022

The plea was moved by two advocates, Aldanish Rein and Ramesh Kumar Mishra, who have contended that the lions portrayed in the emblem appear to be ferocious and aggressive with their mouths open and canines visible, according to Bar and Bench.

The national emblem, made of bronze, was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 12. It is 6.5-metres high and weighs 9,500 kilograms. It is cast on the roof of the new Parliament building, which is a part of the Central Vista project in New Delhi.

The Central Vista project envisages the redevelopment of a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi and is estimated to cost about Rs 20,000 crore.

In their plea before the court, the lawyers have argued that by altering the design of the national emblem, the Centre has violated its sanctity.

'The state emblem of India is the mark of the Identity of the Republic of India,' the lawyers said in their plea, according to Bar and Bench. 'Republic of India belongs to We the Indians. When this identity is interfered with, it hurts the national sentiments of its citizens.'

A day after the national emblem was unveiled, several Opposition leaders had raised questions over its design.

'To completely change the character and nature of the lions on Ashoka's pillar at Sarnath is nothing but a brazen insult to India's National Symbol!' Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had said.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal had said that the lions in the new sculpture appeared to have a 'man-eater tendency'.

The party added, 'The original emblem has a mild expression, but those built during Amrit Kaal show a man-eater's tendency to consume everything in the country.'

Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Jawahar Sircar had said that the new design was an insult to the national symbol.

Insult to our national symbol, the majestic Ashokan Lions. Original is on the left, graceful, regally confident.

'Original is on the left, graceful, regally confident. The one on the right is Modi's version, put above the new Parliament building  snarling, unnecessarily aggressive and disproportionate. Shame! Change it immediately!' Sircar had said while sharing two different images of the emblem.

In response, the government said that the new emblem was a perfect replica of the original, except for its size.

'The original Sarnath Emblem is 1.6-metre high whereas the emblem on the top of the New Parliament building is huge at 6.5 metres,' Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said.

He added: 'If an exact replica of the original were to be placed on the new building, it would barely be visible beyond the peripheral rail. The 'experts' should also know that the original placed in Sarnath is at ground level while the new emblem is at a height of 33 metres from the ground.'",Lions appear aggressive': Plea filed in SC against national emblem atop new Parliament building,7,2022
1076, https://scroll.in/article/1028148/why-are-the-lions-of-the-national-emblem-in-the-new-parliament-building-so-angry ,"The national emblem on the new Parliament building, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, is big. Four bronze lions glower from a pedestal, standing 6.5 metres high. The lions and pedestal together weigh 9,500 kilogrammes.

That is no surprise. By now it is known that the current dispensation's aesthetic is best described as big, preferably biggest. It has under its belt the world's tallest statue and the world's largest infrastructure project. In 2018, Modi inaugurated the new Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters in Delhi, the world's biggest party office. The new national emblem may be the biggest national emblem in India so far.

The major sticking point, however, is that the lions of the new Parliament building are angry. Their bared fangs have caused a minor political storm, with ideological differences coded as aesthetic differences. They roar in four directions, muscles bulging and veins popping, a far cry from the lions of the Ashokan pillar at Sarnath that they were modelled on.

Those lions, it is pointed out, have also been roaring for close to two millennia. But it is a conversational roar rather than a 'look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair'. You do not want to cross paths with the lions of New India on a moonless night.

The lion of Gujarat

As many have observed darkly, lions and the Modi government have a history.

Modi was described as the 'lion of Gujarat', the state he headed for 12 years before moving to the Centre. It helped that lions are also the state animal of Gujarat, the only place in the country where they are found. In the campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi travelled around the country for 'hunkar'  roaring  rallies. He was projected as the 'vikas purush', the development man, a brand of masculinity that combined majoritarian politics with the promise of economic prosperity.

Later, the lion stood for the economic agenda of the Modi government. The 'Make in India' logo pushed out soon after the BJP came to power at the Centre featured a lion made of cogs, a rough beast apparently slouching towards industrial progress.

Industrial progress has been patchy while India has journeyed into an increasingly insecure majoritarian politics, which is now reflected in state functions. The foundation stone for the new Parliament building was laid in a 'bhoomi pujan' ceremony in December 2020. While an interfaith prayer was said, the religious rituals of the majority dominated proceedings. But at Monday's function, only Hindu priests appear to have been present.

The edicts of Ashoka

Some might like their lions resembling a late '80s villain played by Amrish Puri. But it has to be said that the monuments that a civilisation leaves behind are traces of what was valued.

As the old story goes, Ashoka was not always a pious king. He embraced Buddhism in a massive fit of remorse after witnessing the carnage at the battle of Kalinga. The pillars he then scattered across his empire, engraved with edicts, were to spread word of the new faith. They were part of an image makeover as well as an attempt to establish a public code of ethics.

The Ashokan pillar and the lion capital at Sarnath were buried and forgotten for centuries, until British archaeologists dug them up in 1905. Decades later, as the Constituent Assembly of a newly independent India cast around for a national symbol, Nehru tasked Badruddin Tyabji, a civil services officer, with finding one. His wife, Surayya Tyabji, drew the first draft of the emblem.

As their daughter, Laila Tyabji, writes, the couple had just survived the trauma of Partition; Tyabji himself had narrowly escaped being killed. They refused to migrate to Pakistan, rejecting the idea of a state built on religion for a secular, multicultural India. The new national emblem would have inscribed the qualities of the republic they wanted to call home.

Centuries after they were carved, Ashoka's edicts were refurbished for a modern nation state. These edicts suggest how the emperor wanted his reign and his people to be remembered  they were non-violent, tolerant, generous and humane, they were bound together by these values despite their diversity.

After the ceremony, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi accused Modi of 'violating all constitutional norms' by inaugurating the national emblem.

'Constitution separates powers of parliament, government and judiciary,' he said. 'As head of government, [Modi] shouldn't have unveiled the national emblem atop new parliament building. Speaker of Lok Sabha represents LS which isn't subordinate to government.'

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) said that the prime minister, as the head of the executive, subverted the constitutional separation of powers between the three wings of democracy. The party also criticised Modi for performing a puja on the occasion.

'The Constitution of India gives the right and protection to all Indians to practice and profess their faith,' it said. 'This is an inalienable right. At the same time, the Constitution of India clearly stipulates that the State does not profess or practice any faith/religion.'

The Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said that the decision to keep the Opposition out of the event was completely wrong, The Times of India reported.

'Modi is trying to create a Second Republic, a Hindu Rashtra,' he said. 'The decision to not invite Opposition parties to the unveiling was deliberate, against the democratic ethos of India and a bad omen for the country...At one time, BJP spoke of Congress-mukt Bharat, now they also want to create a democracy-mukt Bharat.'

However, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Anil Baluni said that the Opposition's allegations were unfounded and politically motivated, PTI reported.

'Opposition parties questioning the unveiling ceremony should understand the administrative process,' he said. 'Right from parliament's design to funds and constructions supervision, entire work comes under the ambit of the urban development ministry.'

Baluni said that Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building as well.","PM Modi unveiling national emblem at new Parliament building violates Constitution, says Opposition",7,2022

[I am sick and tired of marble arches,

Build a sanctum of clay just for me]  Allama Iqbal, translation Shad Naved

In a Russian folktale I read, there was a monster who, when he saw a hut, destroyed it, when he saw a mountain, smashed it. He went after everything  roads, forests, rivers, people, memories, books and graves. His insatiable desire to destroy kept giving it more power, altering his form and also that of the world around him. He himself became a patchwork of destructions, stamped across his ever-growing body, like the paper Ravanas built in Delhi during Dussehra. The monster became nothing but a whole without parts, a man without qualities, looming over the horizon of the land like shapeless clay and one day falling to pieces and dust.

Today, a similar monster looms, repeating its face across every billboard, every newspaper and every aspect of our psyches, tempering Delhi's permanent horizon. Resurrected on the scaffolding of Hindutva, its appetite for destruction spans eating buildings, histories, lands, communities and forms of the nation state. It also feeds on the minds of people, on democracy, on human rights, on livelihoods and citizenship, making itself stronger and stronger as it goes about its destructions of the present, in the process grafting for the city and the nation an absolute and closed future.

Cities are set in pasts that constantly create their presents. Sunil Kumar's book The Present in Delhi's Pasts (2017) points to both monumental and ordinary architectures and built environments of the city, which represent not only different eras, kingdoms and villages but also the fate of the capital city intertwined with the fate of the nation.

From hidden shrines in forests and Sultanate and Mughal architecture to the neocolonial modernist monumentality of Nehru, Delhi's present is today set within many pasts  pasts that provide a sense of everyday belonging, mnemonic markers of the self, both concrete and crumbling in their manifoldness.

These pasts also are recast in the contemporary as both ideological and political exercises that seep into the destructions of the everyday. Destructions materialise with sudden and overnight removals of buildings and public spaces, with world-class metro stations that eat into street corners that were chai shops, playgrounds or cruising spaces, and with 'authentic' restorations that recast an ordinary public park-like Sundar Nursery into an imagined Mughal garden that is amenable to serve as a global site of consumption.

Different parts of the city hold different meanings for those who come to live in it. The footpath to a bus stop in East Delhi, the view of Purana Qila from a 'mudrika', the first ice cream at India Gate, a market, a park, a housing colony, a route or a stop accumulate to make the city for us and in strange and invisible ways also make us.

Yet, we continue to exist in ourselves and in cities in this constant play of the visible and ever-changing present, jousting constantly with our memories and our present navigating through a place. This play provides us a contemporariness that constantly creates the city and us, and sometimes eludes us in its continuously new forms and presences. This contemporariness adheres a temporal closeness of being caught in 'a' time where one is also caught in its disjunctions and distances.

The road down the street where one cycled to have sugar cane juice and crossed the same tree is now an underpass, a walkway or a metro station. It is caught in simultaneous times, none of which have settled into our bodies.

Today Delhi's contemporariness has come to formulate itself through not only this non-time but also mnemonic violence and speed, where in the era of high capitalism, the Mughal monument is consumed as a commodity fetish and ideologically driven landscapes begin to emerge through street corner lynches, totalitarian laws and new forms of monumental architecture such as the Central Vista. This pace  of metro speed rails, destructions and restorations and totalitarian landscapes of the contemporary  produces a flattened monolithic future to our presents, with such intense violence that we do not know what the city and we have become.

Hannah Arendt in her seminal work The Origins of Totalitarianism (1973) explains the forms in which ideology renders us disconnected from the world of lived experience, creating a simulacrum of histories and of the present. Ideology feeds the life world with forms of control, logical procedures and laws, which explain the 'what is' rather than 'what becomes'.

A screen of 'truer reality' conceals the world of perceptible things, lived lives and forms of the self and nationhood. It also renders a distinct loneliness in people, constantly alienated from the self and from others, feeding on isolation, hurt and sometimes inaction.

Most of all, it closes off the experience with the presence of an incessant semiotic loop of jingoistic, nationalistic, personality-cult-driven explanations and rationalisations led by a singular ideologue amplifying to the people what they need to do and feel and how the nation needs to look. The alterations of the city, the self and the nation align through the material, the symbolic and the real of everyday life. The future is being continuously recast, narrated and rewritten in the present, making the present irretrievable and fixed.

Future as destruction

I am standing at the chowk in a riot-torn neighbourhood of northeast Delhi. It is the February of 2020. As I wait for a friend to appear through the chaos of people I am surrounded with, my eyes are on the maze of lanes flanked by incremental houses in front of me. The smell of roses wafts through the odour of pollution. I am not sure if I have actually smelled the roses or not, and I turn my head around.

Just behind me is a small 8x6 foot structure, a square, covered in tiles and soot, partly broken, damaged, wounded. Women are walking past it, some bowing their heads and peering into the square. The structure looks familiar. I had seen the same shrine in the newspaper  it had been attacked in the riots the previous week.

It had looked darker, more smashed and more burnt in the images  now it looks only like a sombre ruin. Some of the women are whispering prayers and saying 'sab kuch theek ho jayega' (everything will be okay) to the caretaker, who covered in soot, is sitting by the grave and cleaning the railing with locks attached to it. He is trying out keys to open some of the locks, cleaning the locks and nodding and speaking to the women.

People put locks on shrines to ask for boons, something simple like getting a job, passing exams or making a beloved agree for love. Locks always remind me of bridges in Europe  such a non-Protestant aesthetic in a Protestant capitalist world.

'Locks are wish holders  lovers come and put them here,' someone had explained as we walked over a bridge in a small town in Germany. I watch the caretaker cleaning the locks covered with soot. He tells me that the whole shrine was set on fire, yet the grave remained unscathed.

I notice a green shroud covering the grave of the shrine. The caretaker extends his story to it, 'Everything else burned, but the shroud did not catch fire.' I want to believe him. More women come to the threshold of the shrine  their heads are covered with their saree pallus. They move their hands from their heart centres to their foreheads where their bindis are placed. Everything is slowing down, the chaos and traffic  the riot control police and their vans are fading into the lanes, while police sirens are coming together to this axis, this burnt, broken and tired shrine.

The fa�ade of the shrine has cheap bathroom tiles, and now half-wiped soot. The caretaker gets up and starts cleaning the soot with his bare hands. A man appears at the shrine and the caretaker tells me about him, 'He is a mad man. He does not even know if he is Hindu or Muslim. He just comes to sleep at the shrine at night. Why did they hit his hands?'

The caretaker shows me the hands of the man. Other women standing around are looking worried, wondering why anyone would want to burn their local shrine. Down the road from here, everything is burnt, displaced, smashed  the local bakery, tyre shops, the ordinary everyday.

The communal riot, the monster of the mob attack, always attacks the ordinary. It eats into households, neighbourhoods, our minds  it throws open wounds we did not know existed, it slices open households, families, shops and streets. I wonder what axis this shrine has provided to this area, if at all? Did it morph a horizon in this working-class neighbourhood, where people's livelihoods were under constant precarity and destruction? Did it entangle itself into the daily hopes, aspirations and desires of the people who went past it, or did it just stand there as a direction marker? Was it a land grab, a road marker or just another shrine in this city of graves?

The soot of the burnt shrine, the broken street and the simmering nation state has gotten onto my hands and clothes. I am wondering how I will clean this. How will we build back any of this? I do not sleep that night and many nights after. The broken tile pieces from the shrine lie in a box in my house, mixing with my words, myself and my loneliness.

Future as ideology

Ideologies of destruction draw straight lines across people, identities and spaces. They beckon forms of destruction, which are grafted into our bodies, our histories and our futures.

During the second wave of Covid in India, when the national capital had run out of oxygen cylinders and hospital beds for its citizens, with hundreds dying due to lack of state support and care, the regime in power began the construction of the Central Vista 'redevelopment' project.

The aim of this Rs-13,450 crore project is to destroy and reconstruct the 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate and to revamp the central administrative area around Raisina Hill in Lutyen's Delhi. The irreverent, ideologically driven political leadership has singled out this space towards its own distinctively marked and manufactured future.

We can draw a straight line from the destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya to this destruction. Apparatuses of ideology have modes of manifestation and of embedding themselves into existing institutional structures. In the course of the Babri MasjidRam Janmabhoomi dispute, the demolished mosque was made invisible by marking it as 'disputed property', while a real legal entity emerged of the mythical god 'Ram Lalla', in the name of whom the legal case was fought.

The drive for destruction and self-creation in the regime which laid its foundations in the death of history continues in its current form, where it wishes to regraft the historical through its speedy construction drive. The question to ask is not if all regimes have done this before but how this is different from what others have done.

This line of destruction based on ideology seeps into banal architectural plans as Vastu compliant and as a memorial to the future of the city and the country. It is the categorical arrival of Hindutva and Ram Rajya, and the establishment of the nation state and its symbols on this order.

Another set of apparatuses was put into motion by the current regime to progress with the work on the Central Vista  speedy and secretively undertaken tenders, complete impertinence towards heritage laws, and a closed-door decision made by the Delhi Development Authority on use of public parks and public spaces. Regimes render with smooth banality rules, laws and dictates, which alter the way the world can look around us. They normalise control and surveillance through relentless identity cards and random barricading of roads and security checks. One is constantly being made to imagine an enemy, which may not exist in reality, but is conjured up as an entity.

The architectural world, running asunder with its focus on facts rather than values, has been swirling with a buzz on the Central Vista plans. Innumerable discussions and arguments around the plans range from 'it is similar to what the British did to the capital city' and 'it is best for the use and comfort of the Central Secretariat staff and politicians' to 'the old plan could not accommodate enough people' and 'if we do not do it, then who will?'.

Based on arguments of expertise and utilitarianism, the discourse of architecture entirely bypasses the ideological underpinnings that any construction of this scale holds within it. Projecting itself as the all-important axis of this pervasive and persuasive landscape of destructions, the discourse scaffolds a future for the city based on 'architectural gigantism and grim territorial finality'. In working with the ideological, it makes invisible to itself new lines of control, new forms of power and deeply embedded fabrications of a singular future.

Architecture has always served political regimes to mark their presence in the spaces and psyches of people, with the intent of grafting the future in the present. Yet, it is important to understand that the specific syntagmatic performance of architecture under the current regime is based on Hindutva and its apparatuses of ideology in destroying the built, the imagined and the lived spaces of the country.

Future as present

On a cold January morning, I take my mother to Nizamuddin East, an area where she lived for nearly 25 years of her life in Delhi. As we turn in from Khan-i-Khanan's tomb, she asks me where we are, not recognizing the newly restored monument. Her memory, already in the blur of aging, is even more confused as we drive past some of the restored, shiny monuments now interlaced with pillars for new bridges and the metro.

She cannot recognise the domes, understand the turns we are taking or the general sense of the place. Houses have been demolished and rebuilt, parks have been fixed with new landscapes, back lanes do not feel like back lanes and front roads seem to open to new galleries of monumental spaces. In a strange way, the future is already here, and my mother is unable to hold any of her mnemonic markers to it.

Eventually, as we drive around the area and I point to little markers of my childhood walks through the area, such as the Pir Patte Shah shrine, the railway phataks on the back and the very transformed Sundar Nursery, she finally accepts that we are indeed in Nizamuddin East.

When she asks about her friends who once lived here, I have to do the brutal disservice as her daughter of informing her that most of them have now died or moved far away. She is lost again, and pauses and asks, 'Dargah toh bachee hai na? [The dargah is still there, no?]' referring to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya's shrine. I nod and say, 'Yes, it is still here.' But then I think in my head, 'Is it, and for how long?'

What happens to cities, to streets, to people and to us as they transform into new aspirations, forms and ideologies? What does something look like before? Or should we ask, what does it become after? After what? After restoration, after city planning, after ideology, after nation states, after childhoods or after time? Do we wither through this life, this endless loneliness and distance from our pasts and our presents, scaffolded in overnight transformations by regimes and their apparatuses? If the future is here, where is it? And how do I find my way back home?

In reply to a question, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore said that only four projects under the masterplan were currently being implemented. These are construction of new Parliament building, three common Central Secretariat buildings, the vice president's residence and the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue.

Data shared by Kishore showed that the construction of Parliament building is 35% complete and is estimated to be over by October next year. It showed that Rs 340.58 crore have been spent so far out of the estimated cost of Rs 971 crore for the building.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue is 60% over and is likely to be completed by December. The government has spent Rs 190.76 crore of the estimated Rs 608 crore for this.

Resources have been mobilised and the sites were being prepared for the construction of Central Secretariat buildings and the vice president's residence. While the Central Secretariat buildings were likely to completed by November 2023, the construction of the vice president's residence is likely be over by November 2022, the data showed.

(Lok Sabha website)

Congress MP Manish Tiwari, who asked the questions, also sought to know if the project resumed during the coronavirus pandemic while the MP Local Area Development Scheme, or MPLADS, was suspended. The scheme provides funds to MPs to take up development work in their constituencies.

To this, Kishore said that there was no link between the Central Vista Project and MPLADS.

'Separately, the Union Cabinet, in its meeting held on November 10, 2021, has restored MPLAD Scheme for the remaining part of the Financial Year (FY) 2021-'22 and its continuation from FY [financial year] 2022-'23 to FY 2025-'26 with an outlay of Rs 17,417 crore,' he added.

Opposition parties had objected to the Centre's decision to suspend the MPLADS funds in September last year.

'The Central Vista project must be cancelled, and more ventilators must be brought for the common man in this nation,' Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule had said. 'Why is the government not reducing its expenditure to make sure that the costs come down?'

Minister Kishore on Thursday claimed that the Central Vista Project has helped provide direct livelihood to more than 10,000 workers and generated over 24.12 lakh man days of employment.

'In addition, substantial employment in manufacturing and transportation of cement, steel and other building materials have been provided,' Kishore said. 'These works of development/ re-development of Central Vista will contribute to the economy of the country and will help realize our resolve for Aatmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India].'

The minister also informed the quality-cum-cost based method of bidding was not adopted for the construction of the buildings.

'The [quality-cum-cost based method] method has been adopted only for the engagement of consultants for comprehensive architecture and engineering planning for development/redevelopment of the Central Vista,' he added.

The Central Vista project costs Rs 20,000 crore and will redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi.

It has been described by the Opposition as a vanity project of the Bharatiya Janata Party and has also been challenged in courts.

In May, a petition had been filed in the Delhi High Court, saying that the project was not an essential activity and could be put on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the High Court had dismissed the plea. The Delhi High Court had held that the project was of national importance.

1080, https://scroll.in/latest/1011866/central-vista-project-delhi-government-wants-to-halt-work-amid-rising-air-pollution ,"The Delhi government on Wednesday said that it will issue notices to the Centre for continuing work on the Central Vista project despite a temporary ban on most construction activities in the Capital, PTI reported.

'We had been receiving a lot of calls regarding work being carried out at the Central Vista project site despite a ban on construction and demolition activities,' said Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai. 'During an inspection, we found that it was indeed true.'

Delhi and its neighbouring areas have been grappling with poor air quality since Diwali. The air pollution has resulted in restrictions on traffic movement and construction activities and shutting down of schools in the national capital.

Last week, the Supreme Court had re-imposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi in the light of rising pollution levels after it was revoked by the Commission for Air Quality Management on November 22.

The Central Board of Pollution Control on Tuesday said that Delhi's air in November was the worst in six years.

On Wednesday, the Delhi government said it will ask the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to issue a notice to the Central Public Works Department, asking the reason behind the ongoing construction at the Central Vista project site despite the ban.

The 20,000-crore Central Vista project will redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi. A sum of Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, while Rs 13,450 crore will be for new residences of the prime minister and the vice president.

On Saturday, it was reported that the Centre had formed a panel to ensure that the project was completed by the 2026 deadline.

The Central Vista has been described by the Opposition as a vanity project of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The project has also been challenged in courts.

In May, a petition had been filed in the Delhi High Court, saying that the project was not an essential activity and could be put on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the High Court had dismissed the plea.

Central Vista project of national importance: Centre tells SC

Meanwhile, the Centre told the Supreme Court that the Central Vista project and the construction of a new Parliament building was of national importance, reported Live Law.

The government made the statement in an affidavit after the court asked the Centre and state governments on Monday to submit a compliance report on the directions issued by Commission for Air Quality Management before the next hearing to be held on Thursday.

In its May order, the Delhi High Court had also held that the project was of national importance.

In its affidavit before the Supreme Court, the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said that projects of national importance were exempt from the construction ban imposed by the air quality commission.

It said that the government was in compliance with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules which 'includes measures like use of anti-smog gun, mist spray system, use of dust suppressant like magnesium chloride, use of conveyor belt to transfer construction material, keeping all construction material in wet condition etc'.

The affidavit also said that construction work was underway at metro, railways, airports and Inter State Bus Terminals. It said that all other construction work undertaken by the Central Public Works Department have been halted, reported Bar and Bench.

The ministry also submitted that it was willing to submit additional details of the measures it has taken to control pollution at the Central Vista site if the court wanted.",Air pollution: Delhi government seeks halting of work on Central Vista project,12,2021

The deadline to complete the project is 2026, according to The Times of India.

The committee will monitor the pace of the project's execution and ensure that there is 'multi-agency, multi-stakeholder coordination', the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said in an order, according to The Indian Express.

The 20,000-crore Central Vista project will redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi. A sum of Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, while Rs 13,450 crore will be for new residences of the prime minister and the vice president.

The housing ministry said in its order that as the project proceeds, complexities in its implementation are likely to increase, The Indian Express reported.

'Various aspects relating to the project, including development of cultural spaces and seamless coordination between various stakeholders, would need close oversight,' the ministry added.

The committee that has been formed to oversee the project will have a tenure of two years. It will have five members and be led by former finance secretary Ratan P Watal.

The committee will meet regularly, visit the site of the project and submit reports to the government.

The Central Vista has been described by the Opposition as a vanity project of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The project has also been challenged in courts.

In May, a petition had been filed in the Delhi High Court, saying that the project was not an essential activity and could be put on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the court held that it was a project of national importance and dismissed the plea.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court also dismissed a petition challenging the Central Vista project in Delhi.

The petitioner, social activist Rajeev Suri, had argued in the the court that the government proposed to change land use in plot one of the Central Vista area from 'recreational' to 'residential'.

The court said that it could not interfere in the matter unless the petitioner could prove the bad intention behind the decision.

The Central Vista project entails redeveloping a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi. Of the Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, and Rs 13,450 crore on new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

The area that was being reserved for recreational purposes will now have residences of the vice president and the prime minister.

The petitioner said that it will result in loss of recreational and green areas. He had said that the project would take over a children's recreational park and bus terminal.

The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said that the authorities could change plans for the development of the area, NDTV reported.

'It is not [a] private property being created there,' Khanwilkar said. 'The vice president's residence is being created. There is bound to be greenery around. The plan has already been approved by authorities unless you are alleging malafide in that process.'

The court also asked if a common man will now have to be asked where the residence of the vice president should be constructed.

The court further observed that the petitioner's argument of preserving the recreational area could not be the scope of judicial review, according to Live Law. 'It is for the authority concerned and is a matter of public policy,' the court said.

In October, the Centre had urged the Supreme Court to dismiss Suri's 'misconceived' petition challenging land use in the Central Vista project. The government had said that the plot  which will now be a residential zone  had never been opened to the public.

In May, a petition against the Central Vista Project had been filed in the Delhi High Court also. The petitioners had argued that the project was not an essential activity and could be put on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Opposition leaders had also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to suspend work on the Central Vista project in May, when the second wave of coronavirus was raging in India. They wanted the funds to be diverted towards buying oxygen and vaccines that were not sufficiently available at that time.

'Plot No 1 is currently being used as government offices/hutments of the Ministry of Defence for almost 90 years now and no recreational activity exists as per actual ground conditions,' the government said, according to NDTV.

The Centre added that in the Central Vista plan, it has, on its own, decided to expand the space available for recreation, Live Law reported.

'The respondents are cognisant of the public nature of the projects and specifically seek to add various public facilities to the larger vision plan and has suo moto created a lot of space for recreational purposes,' the Centre's affidavit said.

Justice AM Khanwilkar asked Mehta if the recreational space would be moved somewhere else. Mehta indicated that it may not be possible because of security concerns, The Hindu reported. 'The Parliament, etc, is coming up nearby,' he said.

The Supreme Court asked the Centre to file an affidavit in matter. It will hear the case on October 29.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, most construction projects across Delhi were put on hold since the lockdown rules allowed only projects with workers staying on the site to operate.

However, an exception had been made for the Central Vista project, which was declared an 'essential service'.

1085, https://scroll.in/latest/1005548/central-vista-opposition-cares-about-personal-agendas-says-pm-as-he-inaugurates-defence-offices ,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday took a swipe at the Opposition after inaugurating two new defence office complexes constructed at a cost of Rs 775 crore in Delhi as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project.

The Rs 20,000-crore project, which aims to redevelop a stretch in the heart of Lutyens Delhi, has been criticised right from the beginning as an exercise in vanity. Opposition leaders have even described it as a 'criminal wastage' and asked the Modi government to focus on people's lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The new office complexes inaugurated on Thursday will replace the 700 huts spread over 50 acres on Raisina Hills from where the defence ministry used to operate earlier.

Modi said that he was surprised that the defence ministry operated from World War II-era huts, whose condition he claimed was dilapidated. He accused the Opposition of caring more about 'personal agendas' than the condition of government offices and ministries, NDTV reported.

'We all saw how some people tried to sabotage the important Central Vista project... how they ran personal agendas to spread misinformation,' the prime minister said. 'But not once did they speak about the condition of these hutments from where our ministries work. If they had done so, their lies and agendas would have been exposed.'

Modi said the new offices show that his government was giving India's armed forces 'highest priority and honour'.

'This is a big step towards the construction of a modern defence ministry enclave in the capital,' he said. '[It will] further strengthen our efforts to make the working [conditions] of our armed forces more convenient and more effective.'

The prime minister said that modern infrastructure will play an important role in ease of living and ease of doing business. 'This is the spirit at the core of the work being done today related to Central Vista,' he added.

Criticism of Central Vista project

Leaders from 12 opposition parties had asked Modi to suspend the work on the Central Vista project in May, when the second wave of coronavirus was raging in India. They wanted the funds to be diverted towards purchase of oxygen and vaccines which were not sufficiently available at that time.

However, the construction of the project in the national capital was deemed an 'essential service', meaning its work was allowed to continue during the lockdown.

The Narendra Modi government in May had claimed that it was maintaining Covid-19 protocol at the site, which included masking up, sanitisation and thermal screening, and that it had arranged for testing, medical aid and isolation in the event someone fell ill. It also claimed that contractors had provided health insurance to their workers.

However, Scroll.in had found that three workers at the construction site have tested positive for the infection. Many also complained of cramped living conditions  inside tents, tin sheds, metal containers  that had made physical distancing impossible.

In June, the Supreme Court had refused stay a Delhi High Court order that allowed the construction to proceed despite the coronavirus pandemic.","Central Vista: Opposition cares about 'personal agendas', says PM as he inaugurates defence offices",1,2021
1086, https://scroll.in/latest/1002852/parliament-is-temple-of-our-democracy-says-president-kovind-on-independence-day-eve-speech ,"President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said Parliament is 'the temple of our democracy', which provides us the highest forum where we 'discuss, debate and decide issues for the well-being of our people'. These were his first remarks since the end of the Monsoon Session of Parliament ahead of schedule.

The Monsoon Session of Parliament had been chaotic since the beginning. Opposition parties demanded that the Centre discuss the Pegasus surveillance controversy in Parliament. They also criticised the Centre for the farm laws and the sharp increase in prices of fuel and other commodities in the country. But despite repeated demands, the government refused to entertain a discussion on these matters.

During a televised address to the nation ahead of India's 75th Independence Day, the president spoke about several topics, including the novel coronavirus, political developments in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre's new farm laws and Indian sportspersons' achievements at the Tokyo Olympics.

'When India won Independence 75 years ago, many sceptics thought democracy would not survive in India,' he said. 'Little did they know that roots of democracy were nurtured in this soil in ancient times, and even in modern times India was ahead of many western nations in offering franchise to all adults, regardless of any distinctions.'

The President added: 'The founding fathers had reposed their faith in the wisdom of the people, and 'we, the people of India' have made India a strong democracy.'

Kovind also said that it was 'a matter of great pride for all Indians' that Parliament will soon be housed in a new building, which is part of the controversial Central Vista project.

He added: 'It will be a fitting statement of our outlook: It will honour our legacy while also walking in step with the contemporary world. It is more than symbolic that the new building will be inaugurated in the year of the 75th anniversary of Independence.'

The Centre's new farm laws 'will empower our 'annadata' farmers and help them get better price for their produce', the president added.

Thousands of farmers have camped on Delhi's borders since November, demanding that the central government repeal the three laws that open up the country's agriculture markets to private companies. The farmers have hunkered down with supplies that they say will last them for months, and have resolved to not leave until their demands are met.

Coronavirus

The president added that he was deeply pained that many lives could not be saved during the terrible second wave of the coronavirus disease in India.

The Delta variant was responsible for the devastating second wave, which, at its peak, saw more than 4 lakh cases, and thousands of deaths every day. In April and May, several states experienced crippling shortages of oxygen, hospital beds, medical supplies and vaccines, causing citizens to take to social media to ask for help.

'The second wave brought our public healthcare infrastructure under stress,' the president said. 'The reality is that no infrastructure, even of advanced economies, could withstand a crisis of such enormous proportions.'

Kovind said that at the beginning of 2021, there was every reason to be hopeful as the 'largest vaccination exercise in history' had been launched. 'Yet, due to the new variants and other unexpected factors, we suffered from a terrible second wave,' he said.

He added: 'I am deeply sad that many lives could not be saved and many more suffered immensely in this phase of an unprecedented crisis. I speak for the whole nation when I say that I share the grief of all the affected families with the same intensity.'

Though the intensity of the pandemic has come down, the coronavirus disease has not yet gone away, the president said. 'If we have learned our lessons well, we know that this is the time of extra care and caution,' he said. 'We shall not let our guard down. Vaccines are the best possible protection science offers to us.'

More than 53 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India since the beginning of the inoculation drive on January 16, according to data from the Union health ministry.

'Sportspersons brought laurels to the nation'

Kovind also lauded Indian sportspersons who took part in the Tokyo Olympics 2020 for their 'stellar performances'.

'India has won the highest number of medals in the 121 years of its participation in the Olympics,' he said. 'Our daughters have achieved world class excellence in playgrounds overcoming many adversities.'

India won seven medals at the recently-concluded Tokyo Olympics - the medal winners being Neeraj Chopra, Mirabai Chanu, PV Sindhu, Lovlina Borgohain, Ravi Kumar Dahiya, Bajrang Punia and the men's hockey team.","Parliament is temple of our democracy,' says President Kovind on Independence Day eve speech",8,2021
1087, https://scroll.in/article/1000276/interview-central-vista-chief-architect-says-the-project-will-define-a-new-india ,"The Narendra Modi government's project to redevelop India's central administrative area in New Delhi has been in the eye of the storm. But the project's chief architect believes the opposition is mainly due to a lack of awareness.

The Central Vista project, which aims to redevelop and expand India's Parliament, Prime Minister's residence and several other government buildings, has been called a symbol of apathy and has been cited as an example of misplaced priorities of the government in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.

On July 12, a group from Maharastra conducted a public meeting in the capital against the project, arguing that the country 'needs hospitals and not a new mansion for the Prime Minister'. In May, when the project was drawing flak over its continuation despite the catastrophic second wave of Covid-19, the Central Public Works Department prohibited photography and video recording at the construction site, making way for more harsh criticism.

Quartz reached out to Bimal Patel, chief architect of the project, to address these controversies. His firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management had bagged the contract for designing Modi's ambitious project in 2019. The estimated cost of the project is reportedly more than Rs 20,000 crore.

Blaming it all to a lack of adequate information about the project, Patel said, 'Central Vista will play an important role in defining new India.' Excerpts from the interview:

What is your vision for the Central Vista project?

We would like the ongoing transformation of the Central Vista in New Delhi to symbolise that India, as it enters the 75th year of its independence, is confidently resolved to tackle the difficult problems that have plagued it for decades.

That it is resolutely focused on meeting the needs and aspirations of its citizens by modernising itself. That it respects tradition but is not held hostage to it. That it is concerned about the environment but not paralysed by it. That it can be modern, without making a show of its modernity.

The project has six objectives:

Modernising Parliament's facilities: A new Parliament building is proposed adjacent to the existing building. It will be India's first purpose-designed Parliament, equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure to meet all needs of an expanded Parliament. After the present building is retrofitted and refurbished, the two will be used in conjunction. A separate facility to house offices for members of Parliament is also proposed. The present Parliament building, library, and annexe, along with the new Parliament building and chambers for members of Parliament will form the legislative enclave.

There are allegations that the project is destroying Delhi's age-old culture. How true is that?

This is absolutely false. We are very mindful of the heritage character of Central Vista and the very important role that it plays in defining India. If anything, this project is aimed at addressing the many decades of neglect of the vista's buildings and urban elements and restoring them.

How do you deal with the criticism around the project? Do you think it is justified?

We believe that a lack of adequate information about the project in the public domain has fuelled most of the criticism. This project is not unique. The tradition of effectively communicating information about public projects and policies is yet to develop in India.

We do not think that there is anything fundamentally wrong with the project. On account of the lack of adequate information, many people draw the opposite conclusions and end up spreading alarm. This is very unfortunate but there is very little that we can directly do to remedy the situation.

How do you think the future generations will take this revamp?

We are certain that future generations will appreciate that after years of neglect the problems that diminished the functional and architectural character of Central Vista were finally tackled. Future generations will also appreciate the creation of vast new facilities and amenities for the public and government functioning.

How involved is Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the project? Have there been any special demands from him?

Obviously, the Prime Minister is not involved in the details of the project. But his guidance is crucial to defining the overall character of the project. He wants the project to be clearly focused on functional problem solving and on ensuring that all the needs of diverse users are met. He wants the architecture to be modern while celebrating India's rich traditions.

The project has got a lot of attention, not just in India but globally. Does that increase the pressure on you?

Working on such a project imposes a tremendous responsibility that we are mindful of. It is also very difficult to work on because of India's unique diversity. We have people whose sensibilities, attitudes, or beliefs are avant-garde. We also have a vast section whose sensibilities are pre-modern. Our architecture has to speak to all of them.

Has the pandemic forced you to introduce any architectural changes?

No, the pandemic has not affected the design of the buildings.

Has the pandemic or the lockdowns impacted the speed of the project?

The pandemic impeded the pace of construction. However, completion deadlines have not been set back. All efforts are being made to catch up for the lost time.

How eco-friendly will the project be?

Careful considerations have gone into making all parts of the Central Vista project eco-friendly and energy-efficient. In addition to this, consolidation of the central secretariat will allow all government functionaries to share facilities and reduce wasteful duplication of infrastructure. Buildings will use energy-saving technologies and materials.

How different will the new Prime Minister's residence be from the existing one?

The primary difference between the present and new residence for the Prime Minister will be its location. The new residence will be located near the new proposed Prime Minister's Office. On account of this, travel between the two will not disrupt city traffic as it does today. In all other regards, the present and new residences will be very similar.

How did you come up with the design of the new Parliament?

We began by studying the present Parliament building and the historical plans for it ' which included rectangular and triangular options. We documented all the furniture and their arrangements and surveyed the additions and the modifications to the building over the years. We also studied expansion possibilities in the present building, given that the number of Lok Sabha (lower house of the Parliament) representatives are likely to increase after the freeze on its expansion is lifted in 2026.

The adjacent triangular plot was found to be the ideal location for a new building. Based on the shape of the plot and the functions the building has to house, it made sense to lay out the plan in a triangular form, which is a pure geometric form, as the circular form of the present building.

The architecture of the new building is inspired by the present one. Its patterns and motifs are derived from the rich traditional arts and crafts of India.

1088, https://scroll.in/latest/998793/central-vista-supreme-court-refuses-to-stay-delhi-hc-order-allowing-construction-work-to-go-on ,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the Delhi High Court order allowing the Central Vista project work in the national Capital to continue amid the coronavirus crisis, reported Bar and Bench. The top court also refused to interfere with the Rs 1 lakh cost imposed on the petitioners.

The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed that the project activities were in compliance with all Covid-19 protocols.

'Your concern was the project is non-compliant,' said Justice Khanwilkar. 'But when there is a finding that it is compliant then how is the petition being pursued?'

Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi, said that the activities were non-compliant from April 19 to April 30 when the plea was filed. Later, they complied with the conditions, said Luthra.

The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's view that the petitioners had 'selectively' challenged one project. The top court asked if the petitioners had done any research on similar construction works or were they singling out the Central Vista project.

'Was honest research conducted about the kinds of construction work that were going on,' asked Justice Maheshwari. 'Is that reflected in your petition? As a PIL petitioner, did you research on how many projects were going on and only one project is picked up?'

The petitioners' counsel said research was done and referred to the annexures in the plea. 'We had challenged the permission obtained for Central Vista,' he said. 'We also placed on record the DDMA [Delhi Disaster Management Authority] order which permitted the on-site construction. We placed on record the permission letter from CPWD [Central Public Works Department]...movement passes issued were also placed stating it should be allowed as its an essential service. We stated that its not an essential service.'

The Supreme Court said the petitioners should not have pursued the public interest litigation before the High Court further. 'Genuine PILs have done wonders, but questionable PILs have caused problems,' said the court, according to Hindustan Times. 'PILs have their own sanctity.'

The Central Vista project

On May 31, the Delhi High Court held that Central Vista was an 'essential project of national importance'. It also claimed that the public interest litigation filed to stop the project was 'motivated' and fined the petitioners Rs 1 lakh.

The Central Vista project aims to redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi, built in the 1930s. Of the Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, and Rs 13,450 crore on new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

The Narendra Modi government had claimed that it was maintaining Covid-19 protocol at the site, which included masking up, sanitisation and thermal screening, and that it had arranged for testing, medical aid and isolation in the event someone fell ill. It also claimed that contractors had provided health insurance to their workers.

However, Scroll.in found that three workers at the construction site have tested positive for the infection. Many also complained of cramped living conditions  inside tents, tin sheds, metal containers  that had made physical distancing impossible. The supervisor, who oversaw around 30 workers engaged in road construction work on the 3.2-km stretch between Rajpath and Rashtrapati Bhawan, also said that neither he nor the other workers had been insured by the company.

Across Delhi, most construction projects were put on hold since the lockdown rules allowed only projects with workers staying on the site to operate. But an exception had been made for the Central Vista project, which was declared an 'essential service', with permissions to bring workers on buses. On May 29, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had allowed construction activities to resume with certain protocols in place.",Central Vista project: SC refuses to stay Delhi HC order allowing construction work to continue,6,2021
1089, https://scroll.in/latest/997275/central-vista-how-will-records-in-national-archives-annexe-be-kept-safe-historians-ask-department ,"More than 100 historians from India and across the world have written to the head of the National Archives, seeking clarity on how documents stored in the department's annexe, which is proposed to be demolished and replaced with a new building as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, will be kept safe.

The main building of the National Archives will not be demolished, the Centre has said.

The signatories, who include professors from top American and Indian universities, said the National Archives of India's annexe building houses several important documents relevant to historical research. 'What is to become of the materials currently in this Annexe building?' they asked National Archives Director General Chandan Sinha in their letter.

The historians added: 'We seek further information about the deliberations on the proposed rehousing of these materials and the plan of action to keep the records safe during and after the demolition and rebuilding of the Annexe.'

The historians sough clarity on the timeline for the completion of the redevelopment of the National Archives annexe and access to records stored there, so that scholars could plan their research projects accordingly. 'Historians from central and state universities from all over India and the world use these papers for their research,' they added.

The signatories of the letter also sought to know if the National Archives consulted archivists and other stakeholders to assess the need for the future storage of the records.

The historians asked how the change in the National Archives' land-use status from 'public and semi-public' to 'government' will impact the access that scholars have to the materials stored there.

Dear Shri Chandan Sinha,

We, the undersigned, are scholars, students, archivists, and researchers who seek transparency about the proposed changes to the National Archives of India (NAI) , New Delhi during the planned demolition of its current Annexe building as part of the Central Vista Project. A statement to the media on May 20, 2021 by the Hon. Minister of Culture Shri Prahlad Singh Patel seeks to assure researchers and the public that the records will be stored and maintained safely during the redevelopment project.

However, we seek further clarity from you because as the Director General of the NAI, you bear fiduciary responsibility for the Archive's record storage and building redevelopment. The NAI is the custodian of an invaluable repository of historical documents that pertain to important political, social and cultural developments across the country. It belongs as much to India's diverse citizenry and regions as it does to the sovereign state. Historians from central and state universities from all over India and the world use these papers for their research. We therefore consider your response to be essential to ensure the NAI's future as an accessible public space for pursuing historical research by scholars and members of a diverse, multi-lingual public.

1. When and how was the redevelopment deemed necessary? We would like to learn how the NAI consulted with the needs of the archivists and other stakeholders to assess the needs for the future storage of the records development and the status of the buildings in the complex. We would like to know the process by which this discussion unfolded including the public and expert committees that were consulted for the decision to redevelop the site as part of the Central Vista Redevelopment.

2. Land-use status of the National Archives: As part of the Central Vista Project, we have learned that the land-use status of the land on which the old as well as proposed new building of the National Archives has been changed from Public and Semi-Public Land Use (PS1, Socio-Cultural) to Government Land Use (G3 , Govt. offices) vide the Change in Land Use notification issued by MoHUA on 20.03.2020. We learned that the entire campus was notified as a Grade 1 Heritage Site by the Lt. Governor of Delhi on 1st October, 2009 (F. No. 4/2/2009/UD/l 6565) which places restrictions on redevelopment. The Mission of the National Archives of India, as stated on its website, is to 'encourage greater liberalisation of access to archival holdings.' Its Citizen's Charter, also on the website, states that the Archives provide 'facilities for the public use of reference media, records and publications' from its holdings'. How will this change in land use status affect this public-oriented mission, and the rules that govern the public's access to the National Archives? We seek clarity about

the reason behind this change in land use, and details about the deliberations with various stakeholders  professional historians, public consultation, expert committee-deliberations that preceded this decision.

3. New Annexe Building: The Hon. Minister [Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel] has stated on 20th May 2021 that there will be no change to the old building, and that it is the Annexe building that is to be demolished and rebuilt. While the Hon. Minister has declared that 'all the important records are kept in the old building,' the Annexe building also houses several important materials relevant to historical research. What is to become of the materials currently in this Annexe building? We seek further information about the deliberations on the proposed rehousing of these materials, and the plan of action to keep the records safe during and after the demolition and rebuilding of the Annexe. In this regard and given this is a protected heritage site, we also seek clarity about whether the new proposed Annexe building is large enough and adequate to house not just its current holdings but also those that will accumulate in the decades to come. What percentage of the NAI's holdings have been digitized or microfilmed to date, and how will the digitization process be affected by the impending move?

4. Access during redevelopment: As you are aware, researchers from doctoral scholars to senior historians have to plan their research schedules well in advance when submitting grant applications, research proposals, or making travel plans for doing archival research. A Culture Ministry official has been quoted in the media as saying that the redevelopment could Take up to 2026 to be completed. The NAI, we hear in the media, might be completed in 2024. The complete lack of any clarity about this timeline of redevelopment has left us dismayed about how to plan for research in the coming years and guide our students accordingly. Therefore, we seek concrete responses to the following questions: What is the anticipated schedule for the National Archives to move all its records to its new home? What will be the phases of this work, and how will this affect the availability of records, either fully or partially, to scholars during the transfer process? Has this schedule and its protocols of transfer been drawn up in consultation with professional historians and archivists? If so, we seek clarity on the deliberations of these decisions.

It is imperative that the NAI make all this information available in the public domain, beginning with the process undertaken to decide that redevelopment was necessary, the way in which the NAI intends to plan the schedule of phases of transfer, and any plans for partially or fully closing the National Archives available to researchers and the public. The National Archives of India's holdings tell the story of a diverse and interconnected people who comprise the Union of India. This story pertains not only to the past, but the present as well, since not only historians turn to the archive, but also people from various professions: lawyers, doctors, artists, property developers, government departments who consult records from different historical eras, regions, languages, and scripts for their work. The lack of official information in the public domain from the Director General's office concerns us greatly as potential unplanned or unanticipated disruption to access will have a huge impact on the NAI's myriad users and well wishers.

We therefore urge you to respond actively and positively through a detailed communication on your website to all our concerns in this letter. We also urge you to involve us, the scholarly public, in these consultations regarding the future of the NAI. We look forward to hearing from you.

1090, https://scroll.in/latest/996466/central-vista-project-plea-filed-in-sc-challenging-delhi-hc-verdict-allowing-construction ,"In a plea to the Supreme Court, a petitioner has challenged the Delhi High Court's decision to allow the Central Vista project work to continue despite the coronavirus pandemic, Bar and Bench reported on Wednesday.

On Monday, the High Court held that Central Vista was an 'essential project of national importance'. It also claimed that the public interest litigation filed to stop the project was 'motivated' and fined the petitioners Rs 1 lakh.

However, in his plea to the Supreme Court, appellant Pradeep Kumar Yadav, contended that the High Court's decision to regard the project as 'essential activity' was not justified amid the coronavirus crisis. The plea also objected to the High Court's observation that the November 2021 deadline to complete the project was essential.

'Compared to the larger interest of protecting lives of people, sanctity of a date of completion of the project for construction can have no meaning, relevance or importance,' the plea stated.

It claimed that workers involved in the project were not staying at the construction site, as was mentioned in the High Court judgement.

'...Respondent Government and [construction firm] SPCPL [Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited] in their respective affidavit has clearly stated that the workers of the said project was staying at Sarai Kale Khan Camp which is not project site,' the plea said.

The Central Vista project aims to redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi, built in the 1930s. Of the Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, and Rs 13,450 crore on new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

1091, https://scroll.in/article/995975/central-vista-project-raises-the-question-who-owns-the-national-archives-of-india ,"The Narendra Modi government's Central Vista project in New Delhi looks to demolish the National Museum of India, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, and the annexe of the National Archives of India. The National Archives Museum, which is housed within the National Archives building, is also under renovation. The immediate future of the contents of these institutions is unclear.

Particularly as far as the texts from the National Archives are concerned, there has been little disclosure on the processes of the transfer of files, any imminent division of the registers, and any consequent changes to cataloguing. Will files pertaining to specific ministries be redirected to their respective historical divisions? What will be done to ensure the safety and integrity of the holdings that are yet to be declassified and therefore, haven't ever been accessed by a general readership? Who will appraise the condition of both temporary and permanent collections and what compliance will be enforced upon them? What do these sweeping changes mean for historians and other users of the archives?

There are no clear answers to any of these issues in blatant disregard of the mission statement of the National Archives of India that says the organisation seeks to 'encourage the scientific management, administration and conservation of records all over the country'.

A fundamental philosophical invocation that every nation state has to confront at some contentious point in its history is  who owns the archives? Or, to be more provocative  if the State runs the archives, does it also own it?

An archivist will point to the primary values of an archive, amongst them both administrative and historical, to better inform this context. Taken together, these values imply that in fact, the archive could be, and often is, a site of accountability. Through scholarly practice, in social science, humanities and beyond, an archive is where historical writing and revisionism becomes possible. As more and new material emerges, and archival records are accessed and read, the collective memory of a nation evolves.

Historical debates are largely devoted to and revolve on unearthing mechanisms of state power inscribed in its textual forms, embodied in the archives, and ideally protected for posterity. In effect, admittance to archives is politically unrestrained. As such, a national archive can be seen as an expression of the social contract, and beyond, as archives frequently attract a global audience.

An archivist will also point to the secondary values of an archive, of which the most pertinent to India today is the intrinsic value of records. After all, the archives and what they contain, and what they redact or expunge, speaks to the very heart of visibility and presence in a power-laden polity, and its historical chronicle. In the absence of textual evidence, the manipulation of national memory becomes a real possibility, with no basis for verification.

The global argument for the neutrality of the archive has acquired sophistication, looking at the curation of material as neutral and moderated, speaking to the positionality of both the archivist, who constructs the archive but also the consumer, who translates or writes up archival material. This is a question of expertise and reflexivity, where the curator is aware, because they have attained the professional expertise to, of their self in relation to the archive. Blithely doing away with these critical notions has its own ideological implications.

With respect to India, there is such angst amongst the scholarly community in light of these new changes because the engagement with the archive even in its present pre-renovated condition, is often stymied by the 35-year declassification criteria, and a belated and painfully slow enactment of the rules. Most material now widely used only became available to scholars in the early 2000s, which also still involves jumping through hoops. Now on, it may cease to exist, or at the very least, become untraceable.

What historians specifically are feeling is not only shock but also a sense of bereavement as the discipline depends so heavily on these materials, and on access to them. This indiscriminate treatment of these holdings may prove catastrophic to scholarship on India articulated from the Global South. Burdened by the institutional inequalities already plaguing the ramparts within which humanities and the social sciences function as disciplines outside the West and coupled with the exigencies of having to constantly make space for speech and activism by virtue of inhabiting these spaces, will cause added and widespread attrition and financial and social distress. Can we afford this as a nation?

An Indian political thinker would say that to know the future, ask a historian. To know who said this, you'd have to step into an archive.

1092, https://scroll.in/latest/996212/central-vista-project-delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-to-stop-construction ,"The Delhi High Court on Monday decided to allow the Central Vista project work to continue during the coronavirus outbreak, Bar and Bench reported.

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said Central Vista was an 'essential project of national importance'. 'Public is vitally interested in the project,' the court added.

The court claimed that the public interest litigation to stop the project was 'motivated' and fined the petitioners Rs 1 lakh.

'They have to complete the construction before November 2021,' the court said, according to Bar and Bench. 'Time is of essence. Once workers are staying at site and all facilities are provided and Covid-19 behaviour are adhered to, no reason to stop the project. This is not a genuine PIL.'

The Central Vista project aims to redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi, built in the 1930s. Of the Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, and Rs 13,450 crore on new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

On May 17, the judges had reserved their verdict after hearing both sides for more than three hours. A joint petition was filed by Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker. They argued that the Central Vista project was not an essential activity and can be put on hold in light of the pandemic.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehra, representing the Centre, had called the petition a 'facade' and a 'disguise' to stall the project, which they always wanted to stop. But, the petitioners told the court they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area.

Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, one of India's largest construction firms which has been awarded the tender for the project, said the plea lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workers.

The counsel for the petitioners had likened the project to Auschwitz death camp during World War II.

The Modi government had claimed that it was maintaining Covid-19 protocol at the site, which included masking up, sanitisation and thermal screening, and that it had arranged for testing, medical aid and isolation in the event someone fell ill. It also claimed that contractors had provided health insurance to their workers.

1093, https://scroll.in/article/995968/three-workers-at-central-vista-contract-covid-19-many-complain-of-cramped-living-space-late-wages ,"It was the last week of April, when a coronavirus surge was devastating Delhi, with overwhelmed hospitals running out of oxygen, and crematoriums running out of space. India's capital was under a strict lockdown. Most economic activity had come to a halt.

But every morning, a 50-year-old construction supervisor travelled over 20 km from his home in West Delhi to the heart of the city to supervise a small part of the Narendra Modi government's ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.

Across the city, most construction projects had stalled since the lockdown rules allowed only projects with workers staying on the site to operate. But an exception had been made for the Central Vista project, which was declared an 'essential service', with permissions to bring workers on buses, as Scroll.in had first reported.

The supervisor, who asked to remain anonymous, oversaw around 30 workers engaged in road construction work on the 3.2-km stretch between Rajpath and Rashtrapati Bhawan. He had been working on the site since February. He spent nearly 12 hours there everyday.

On April 26, however, he woke up with a fever and decided to skip work. When the fever did not break for days, he went to a government-run Ayurvedic hospital on May 1, he said.

There, he stood in a queue for a token and waited for over an hour before his turn came to lean towards a window, to allow a health worker to take his nasal swab, he recalled. An hour later, he was told he had tested positive for Covid-19. He asked for his test report, he said, but wasn't given one.

Over the next few days, his fever lingered, he lost his sense of smell and taste, and experienced breathlessness, he said. Other members in his family, too, developed Covid-like symptoms.

Although the supervisor does not have a test report to back up his claims of a Covid-19 infection, he insisted: 'I got it from the site and other workers fell ill as well.'

After criticism of the Central Vista project had mounted in light of the pandemic, the government had barred access to the project site, even prohibiting photography. But Scroll.in was able to visit a corner of the site and speak to more than a dozen workers, in person and on the phone, who complained of cramped living conditions  inside tents, tin sheds, metal containers  that had made social distancing impossible. One person at the site said three workers had tested positive for Covid-19.

A spokesperson of the Central Public Works Department, the government agency responsible for executing the project, confirmed the three Covid-19 infections. In response to Scroll.in's questions, he said the agency had carried out 263 RT-PCR tests at the site in May, 'out of which 260 were found negative and only 3 were found positive. All positive workers are kept in isolation rooms/wards and given free medical assistance.' He did not respond to further questions about the workers' medical treatment.

Abandoned in illness

While the Central Public Works Department has acknowledged the three confirmed infections, the supervisor's case raises the possibility that other infections may have gone unaccounted for, since he was not tested for Covid-19 at the project site.

His test at the government-run Ayurvedic hospital, Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan in Najafgarh, itself remains shrouded in mystery, since he said he was not given a report. 'They [the health workers] just said that all those who were positive should go to another room and take the medicines from there, but they gave a slip to those who had tested negative,' he said.

An attendant at the hospital refuted this. He said slips were issued in the case of rapid antigen tests, for both positive and negative cases, while reports for RT-PCR tests were given in three days. 'If he has done an RT-PCR test, then he can come and collect the report,' said Anil, an attendant at the medical superintendent's office, who only goes by one name.

The supervisor said he was unable to get himself tested for Covid-19 at a private laboratory  there were no slots available. But he ran several blood tests at a lab in West Delhi, where he tested positive for typhoid.

The next few days, he stayed at home, in a feverish state, finding it difficult to take in full breaths. 'I was barely conscious,' he said. He monitored his oxygen levels on an oximeter. On a couple of occasions, the levels fell below the safe mark of 94 percent saturation, but not for long enough to warrant the impossible task of looking for a bed in the hospital, he said.

When others in his family developed symptoms, they did not bother running around to get a test done. They simply took the cocktail of medicines that he claimed another doctor had prescribed him, which, apart from Vitamin C tablets, included Azithromycin, an antibiotic, and Ivermectin, an antiviral, that were being used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, despite no evidence to back their use.

By the third week of May, the supervisor and his family had recovered from the bout of illness. On May 19, he went back for another Covid-19 test at the same hospital  this time, he was given a slip that said he had tested negative on a rapid antigen test.

But he still feels weak. 'I get breathless even if I walk ten steps to the bathroom,' he said.

His main grouse: 'The company did not help.' He was referring to Garg Builders, one of the subcontractors executing the Central Vista avenue redevelopment work that had been awarded to Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, one of India's largest construction firms. The supervisor said he had been working at Garg Builders for 30 years.

'They kept saying they would give me money in my account after I told them I had Covid, but they just made me a fool,' he said. 'No one gave us medicines or salary.'

The supervisor said he was last paid his monthly salary of Rs 27,000 in March. The illness had cost him and his family Rs 30,000, and they had taken loans from friends to meet these expenses.

Scroll.in contacted Garg Builders whose manager admitted that salaries had not been paid since March, but claimed that was because the office had been shut during the lockdown, making it difficult to hand out cash and cheques.

'The accounts will be cleared once the lockdown opens,' said Pawan, a manager at the company, who goes by his first name. 'We paid some of the workers in advance also. We do not want to keep anyone's money.'

When asked about the case of the supervisor, Pawan claimed employees who had fallen ill were asked to send someone to collect money on their behalf. 'But no one came because of Covid,' he said.

The supervisor said he was unable to go or send his son to collect the money because they were ill. 'He [the manager] has a staff of ten to 15 people, he could have sent them instead,' he said.

About the company's policy on keeping workers safe during a pandemic, the manager said: 'We did not force anyone to go to work even though the government has opened construction.'

In a photo taken in the last week of April, workers can be seen digging a trench near India Gate as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project.

In response to a petition filed in the Supreme Court, calling for construction work at the Central Vista project to be stopped in light of the pandemic, the Modi government had claimed that it was maintaining Covid-19 protocol on the site, which included masking up, sanitisation and thermal screening, and that it had arranged for testing, medical aid and isolation, in the event someone fell ill. It also claimed that contractors had provided health insurance to their workers.

But the supervisor alleged there were no serious measures being taken on the site to protect workers from Covid-19. 'We wore a mask, but apart from that there were no other precautions enforced,' he said. He said neither he nor the other workers had been insured by the company.

While Scroll.in cannot independently verify the supervisor's claim about his own illness, his description of the working and living conditions at the site match what we found on the ground, and what other workers described, when we visited the area on May 23.

Cramped in a tin shed

It was a Sunday afternoon. Workers operated earthmovers, dug around the canals near India Gate, and shifted pipelines underground.

Among them were two young crane-operators from Amritsar, Punjab, who said they worked for a Gurugram-based company, Jaspal Crane, that paid them Rs 23,000 as monthly wages. They had started work at the stretch in February. Only once had they been tested for Covid-19, they claimed  in the month of April.

While the crane-operators had no complaints as far as wage payments go  they said their contractor paid them regularly, sometimes even in advance  they pointed out their living conditions were far from ideal.

They had been living in a tin shed, propped up on the edge of Janpath road, surrounded by layers of muck and mud from the previous week's rain. Three tin sheds stood there in a row. Each was not more than seven-feet wide, barely enough to accommodate one person, but the company had made two workers share one.

Inside their shed were a charpoy and a metal bed stand placed close to each other. There were no mattresses on either of them except a layer of plywood lay on top of the metal bed stand. Another tin shed even lacked this basic arrangement: the two workers that lived there slept on a thin layer of mattress placed on the floor.

When it rained in the city over the past week, rainwater had leaked into the sheds, making it impossible to stay dry indoors, the workers said. 'We were awake the whole night,' said a 23-year old. 'The whole place was filled with water.'

On most other days, the tin sheds would heat up, making it hard to spend even a few hours inside every night. The 23-year-old said he spent Rs 4,500 to buy himself a cooler.

'We had to bring our own mattresses, gas stove,' said the other worker from Amritsar, a 22-year old. They cooked for themselves inside the shed, buying provisions from the Rs 1,000-weekly allowance their contractor gave them.

To relieve themselves, they had to walk at least 500 metres to access mobile toilets. And they had to fill buckets of water from a lone tanker and bathe in the open.

Said a 20-year old from Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, who works as a plumber, fixing the water motors at the canals on the site: 'Everyone stands in a line [in front of the water tanker] with their buckets as if we are all prison inmates.'

Overcrowded tents

A larger group of workers seemed to be living in tents, which Scroll.in was not able to access.

A 47-year-old man, who identified himself as a casual worker of Reckon Constructions, said six to eight workers shared one tent. There were 30-40 tents at the site, equipped with mattresses and fans, he said.

The spokesperson of the Central Public Works Department denied workers lived in tin sheds, but confirmed the presence of tents. 'We have provided waterproof tent,' he said. 'In size of 15 feet by 15 feet, only 6-8 workers are residing,' he said. A standard king-sized bed is 6 feet by 6.5 feet.

Originally from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, the 47-year-old worker had been living and working on the site since May 5, and was earning Rs 400 as daily wages and an additional Rs 200, if he worked overtime, he said. He had barely worked for 15 days and was expecting payments at the end of the month.

On May 7, he had been tested for Covid-19, with ten other workers employed by the same contractor. His result was negative but the contractor did not clarify what would happen if he had tested positive. 'He would tell us to go home if anyone got Covid,' the worker speculated.

After the lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 16, many workers from the site had gone back home. Work had come to a halt in some pockets of the stretch. Some workers had stayed back, only to collect their salaries.

Life in a container

The Central Vista project aims to redevelop a stretch at the heart of Lutyens Delhi, built in the 1930s. Of the Rs 20,000-crore sanctioned for the project, Rs 971 crore will be spent on a new Parliament building, and Rs 13,450 crore on a new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.

On the site, apart from tin sheds and tents, there was a third kind of worker accommodation: metal containers. A 47-year-old worker from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, who is now back in his village, said he had lived for two months with three other workers inside a metal container  'the kind in which goods are stored', he said.

'We all slept on the same bed and just managed somehow,' said the worker, who spoke to Scroll.in on the phone. He said he had been hired by Garg Builders in March. He had requested the supervisor to arrange for separate mattresses for the workers in the container that was ridden with mosquitoes, but the request was ignored.

'Our supervisor only called in the morning to ask if we started the cranes and the work,' he said. 'He never asked us about what we ate or how we slept at night.' Another worker from Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, echoed the same view.

In response to the allegations of poor living conditions, Pawan, the manager at Garg Builders, said three containers were shared between four to five workers. 'What problem do they have living in a 40 feet wide container?' he asked. 'We gave them four mattresses. It is their headache whether they sleep separately or together.

The worker left Delhi in the first week of May, after Garg Builders stopped work at the site. Like the supervisor who had fallen ill, the worker, too, said he was yet to receive his pending wages of Rs 16,000 for the month of April.

Signboards reading 'no photography' and 'no video recording' have been put up at the site.

The Central Vista project is an initiative of the Narendra Modi government. It aims to redevelop a 3.2-km stretch called the Central Vista that lies at the heart of Lutyens Delhi built by the British in the 1930s. It involves tearing down and rebuilding several government buildings, including iconic landmarks, and constructing a new Parliament at a total cost of Rs 20,000 crore.

The construction of the prime minister and vice president's residences is likely to be over by 2022.

The Centre has faced criticism for continuing with construction work for the project amid a lockdown in Delhi, even as a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic rages across the country. The construction at the site in Delhi has been deemed an 'essential service', meaning work continues even during the lockdown.

India has reported more than 3 lakh cases a day every day for the past three weeks, since April 22. On Thursday, India registered 3,62,727 new coronavirus cases, taking the tally in the country to 2,37,03,665 since the pandemic broke out in January last year. With 4,120 deaths, the toll climbed to 2,58,317.

On Wednesday, leaders of 12 Opposition parties wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to suspend the Central Vista project and instead divert the money to buy oxygen and vaccines, supplies of which are running dangerously low.

As many as 65 civil society groups and environmental organisations on Wednesday also appealed to the Centre to halt the project.

'All the unnecessary expenditures, including the construction of lavish Central Vista, must be halted and all available resources must be diverted to urgent Covid response,' said a statement issued by Vikalp Sangam, one of the organisations.

The full focus of economic activities in the name of development from now on must be on human and environmental health and well-being, it said. 'While the central and state governments have necessary resources to carry these out, and must be held accountable for them, civil society groups and bodies of local self-governance in villages and cities must also put full efforts into making these possible,' the statement added.

1095, https://scroll.in/latest/994774/coronavirus-give-free-vaccines-halt-central-vista-project-12-opposition-leaders-tell-pm-modi ,"Leaders of 12 opposition parties on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging the government to provide free vaccines for all citizens and to procure urgent supplies from overseas as the coronavirus rampages through the country, The Indian Express reported.

The leaders also demanded that authorities suspend the Central Vista Redevelopment Project and instead divert the money to buy oxygen and vaccines, supplies of which are running dangerously low. The construction at the site in Delhi has been deemed an 'essential service', meaning work continues even during the lockdown.

Besides, the politicians once again urged the Centre to repeal the three agricultural laws which, they claimed, will help protect lakhs of protesting farmers from becoming the victims of pandemic.

The signatories to the joint letter included, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, Trinamool Congress' Mamata Banerjee, DMK chief MK Stalin and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury.

The politicians blamed the central government for the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which they said had 'assumed unprecedented dimensions of a human catastrophe'.

The leaders said they had repeatedly drawn the government's attention to the various measures that were 'absolutely imperative' in order to rein in the pandemic. But 'unfortunately, your government has either ignored or refused all these suggestions,' they told Modi. 'This only compounded the situation to reach such an apocalyptic human tragedy.'

The politicians put forward nine main demands, which they said should be undertaken 'on a war-footing' by the government.

'Procure vaccines centrally from all available sources  global and domestic,' they said. 'Immediately begin a free, universal mass vaccination campaign across the country. Invoke compulsory licensing to expand domestic vaccine production. Spend budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crores for the vaccines.'

The opposition leaders demanded giving all jobless at least Rs 6,000 per month and a free distribution of foodgrains to the needy, saying over one crore tonnes of foodgrains are currently 'rotting in central godowns'.

They also urged the government to release all money held in the 'unaccounted private trust fund, PM Cares' to buy more vaccines, oxygen and medical equipment required.

India has reported more than 3 lakh cases a day every day for the past three weeks, since April 22. On May 1, it hit a new record by crossing the 4-lakh mark, the highest single-day tally by any country in the world. This was surpassed on May 7, when India recorded 4.14 lakh daily cases. So far in May, India's daily tally has crossed the 4-lakh mark on five days. Thousands have died every day, but reports allege that the government is severely undercounting Covid-19 deaths.

The brutal second wave have left the country's healthcare system on the brink of collapse, leading to shortages in oxygens, hospital beds and medicines. The government is now trying to arrange supplies from abroad.

Many people have died in ambulances and car parks waiting for a bed or oxygen, while morgues and crematoriums are overflowing with bodies. The surge in infections has coincided with a dramatic drop in vaccinations because of supply and delivery problems.","Coronavirus: Give free vaccines, halt Central Vista project, 12 Opposition leaders tell PM Modi",12,2021
1096, https://scroll.in/latest/994643/central-vista-centre-opposes-plea-to-halt-construction-work-says-another-attempt-to-stall-project ,"The Centre on Tuesday opposed a plea before the Delhi High Court seeking to halt the construction activity of the Central Vista project, saying that it was just another attempt to stall the work, reported PTI. The Centre said that it has faced such attempts from the beginning on one pretext or another.

'The very fact that out of all these construction activities going on simultaneously for different projects by different agencies, the petitioner has chosen to be a public spirited citizen only with regard to one project speaks volumes about his intentions and motive behind filing the present petition,' the central government said in an affidavit.

A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh listed the matter for hearing on May 12 as the affidavit was not on record. The plea sought to suspend the construction work of the project in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

The project, an initiative of the Narendra Modi government, aims to redevelop a 3.2-km stretch called the Central Vista that lies at the heart of Lutyens Delhi built by the British in the 1930s. It involves tearing down and rebuilding several government buildings, including iconic landmarks, and constructing a new Parliament at a total cost of Rs 20,000 crore. The construction of the prime minister and vice president's residences is likely to be over by 2022.

In its affidavit, the government said the Delhi Development Authority and the city's Public Works Department are also engaged in construction works but the plea has overlooked it, reported Bar and Bench.

The fact that the petitioners were selective about their 'public interest' should bar them from any relief, the affidavit said. The Centre claimed that the petition should be dismissed as it is motivated by some other factor in the garb of public interest.

The affidavit also told the High Court that the construction work is not related to the new Parliament building or offices. It said that the activity pertains to building public amenities such as parking spaces, paths, toilet blocks and underpasses and claimed that the petitioners were aware of this but chose to suppress the information.

The government also told the High Court that it has made full arrangements to ensure that the construction activity is carried out in compliance with the coronavirus guidelines.

It said a facility was set up at the construction site to accommodate the workers who wanted to continue with the work. 'The facility provides for strict implementation of Covid protocol strictly and also adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour, such as sanitization, thermal screening, physical/social distancing and masking,' the affidavit said.

The government also said that the 400 workers engaged in the construction work were there before a curfew was imposed in Delhi, reported Live Law. It said that permission for transporting material and labour to the work site was granted between April 19 and April 30. It added that the government has set up a dedicated healthcare facility and the workers have proper access to medical care.

The Delhi High Court had on Monday agreed to hear the plea and asked the petitioners to file a fresh application on the matter. The decision came after the Supreme Court on May 7 refused to interfere with the Central Vista project as the case was already in front of the Delhi High Court but permitted the petitioners to seek an urgent hearing from the High Court.

Before that, the petitioners had first approached the Delhi High Court last week but it adjourned the case till May 17 without hearing it.

The petitioners have said that the construction work has the potential to become a super spreader of the coronavirus. They have also questioned Delhi Deputy Commissioner of Police Eish Singhal's decision to issue movement passes in the 'essential services' category to vehicles engaged in the project.

The health infrastructure in Delhi is under severe strain due to the alarming number of cases reported in the city. There is an acute shortage of medical supplies, especially oxygen. Beds are also scarce for Covid-19 patients who need urgent admission.

As per a Scroll.in investigation, the cost of 162 oxygen generation plants being built by the central government is Rs 201 crore. In contrast, the budget for the new Parliament building itself is nearly five times more at Rs 971 crore.

However, the Supreme Court permitted the petitioners to seek an urgent hearing from the Delhi High Court.

'In the given circumstance, we request Shri Luthra [petitioners' counsel] or any other counsel to make request before the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court on Monday to take up the matter as urgently as possible. We hope and trust that High Court shall consider the prayer for early hearing.'

The Centre opposed the plea and claimed that the petitioners' Special Leave Petition against an adjournment raised serious questions.

Referring to the Delhi High Court's adjournment, the petitioners told the Supreme Court:

'The very purpose of the petition is to seek a direction to the Respondents to forthwith, stop back and forth movement of workers by buses from Sarai Kale Khan, Karol Bagh, Kirti Nagar and other areas around Delhi (where they reside with their families) to the site of the construction activity at the 'Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project' (hereinafter referred to as 'the Project') during the subsistence of this peak phase of the pandemic in New Delhi, when oxygen is in short supply and the healthcare system is in total collapse.'  The plea

Luthra added: 'I really don't understand how construction can be an essential activity when it puts lives of workers in danger and put more pressure on health care system.'

The petition added that there was no logic for the Central Vista Project being designated an essential service, especially just for the sake of a contractual obligation.

Only construction projects that have workers staying on the site are permitted to operate in Delhi as per lockdown guidelines. However, an exception was made for the Central Vista project.

'In the current dismal scenario, this Project has no feature of 'essentiality' for and/or of 'service' to the public at large,' the petition said, according to Bar and Bench. 'In the absence of provision of on-site accommodation in this project, the impugned acts are totally contrary to and in gross violation of the orders issued in the public interest by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.'

The petition in the Delhi High Court had said that the construction work has the potential to become a super spreader of the coronavirus and also questioned Delhi Deputy Commissioner of Police Eish Singhal's decision to issue movement passes in the 'essential services' category to vehicles engaged in the project.

Hitting out at the Centre, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that at a time when people are grappling with the shortage of oxygen and vaccines in the country, it would be better if the government deploys all resources to save lives instead of building a new Rs 13,000-crore house for the prime minister.

The Opposition has severely criticised the Centra Vista Project as it has been viewed as a vanity project of the Bharatiya Janata Party, especially as India battles a severe health crisis.

The vice president's new living quarters is likely to be finished by May next year under the project, according to the Central Public Works Department. The prime minister's current official address is 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, and the vice president resides in 6, Maulana Azad Road, in New Delhi.

The Central Public Works Department was made the nodal agency for the project. The announcement came as the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change's expert appraisal committee granted the required clearance for the other buildings under this plan. A Common Central Secretariat and a building for the Special Protection Group will also be constructed.

The Union environment ministry's expert panel had held a meeting on April 13 on the matter, but the details of the meeting was made public on Monday.

The Central Public Works Department's submission noted that the new Parliament will be constructed by November 2022, according to NDTV.

The stated aim of the project, being supervised under the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs, was to to set up a new Parliament by India's 75th Independence Day next year. The remainder of the project, including construction of 11 administrative buildings, is likely to completed by 2024.

He said that it was 'ironical' that the Centre has Rs 14,000 crore for the project and Rs 8,000 crore for buying aircraft for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the times of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recession. 'But the same BJP Govt imposes cuts of 37,530 CR in allowances of 113 Lakh Armed Forces & Central Govt Employees & Pensioners,' he tweeted.

1102, https://scroll.in/latest/983169/sc-approves-central-vista-redevelopment-project ,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to the Central Vista project in a 2:1 verdict, Bar and Bench reported. The court rejected petitions challenging the project over alleged violation of environmental and land-use rules.

The bench noted that the environmental clearances granted to the project by the Ministry of Environment were valid and proper. It also observed that the exercise of the power under the Delhi Development Authority Act was just and valid.

'Selection and appointment of environmental consultant in the case is held to be just and proper,' Justice AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna agreed with the other judges on the awarding of project, but differed from them on the question of land use. He noted that there was no disclosure for public participation on the matter, PTI reported.

'However, on the question of grant of change of land use, I have held that the same was bad in law,' Khanna said, according to Bar and Bench. 'There was no prior approval of Heritage Conservation Committee and thus matter is remitted back for public hearing. On the environmental clearance aspect, it was a non speaking order.'

The Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project seeks to redevelop government buildings situated on the three-km stretch in Delhi that runs from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. A new Parliament house is at the heart of the project.

1103, https://scroll.in/latest/982014/pursuit-of-pomp-69-former-bureaucrats-criticise-centre-for-building-new-parliament-amid-pandemic ,"A group of former bureaucrats on Tuesday criticised the Centre's decision to build a new Parliament amid the coronavirus crisis and India's economic decline, calling it a 'pursuit of grandeur'. They hit out at the Narendra Modi government for going ahead with the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista revamp, even as questions concerning its approval were being heard by the Supreme Court.

Sixty-nine former officers, coming together as the Constitutional Conduct Group, wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra about the manner in which the Centre was proceeding with the project. The signatories of the letter include human rights activist and former Indian Administrative Service officer Harsh Mander, former Vice Chairman of Delhi Development Authority VS Ailawadi and former Special Secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing Anand Arni, among others.

'It is a matter of great dismay that at a time when we are faced with an economy in perilous decline and a pandemic which has brought untold misery to millions, the government has chosen to invest vast sums on a project which represents nothing but the pursuit of pomp and grandeur,' the signatories said.

They added: 'We have a public health infrastructure crying out for investment of public resources that could benefit substantially from the kind of investment planned for the Central Vista project; yet, for the government it seems that this wasteful and unnecessary project must take precedence over social priorities like health and education.'

The former bureaucrats said the since the beginning, the ambitious Central Vista project was marked by 'executive highhandedness rarely witnessed before'. 'You [the prime minister] are aware that the legality of the various approvals given has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the cases have been heard and reserved for orders on November 7, 2020,' the letter said. 'Despite these facts, your government acted as if this were only a minor hindrance and blithely went ahead with implementing the construction plans, starting with removing several trees and planning a major foundation stone laying ceremony.'

The signatories added:

'We believe that this was the height of impropriety when the very basics of the project were under challenge. While the case was sub judice, it was incumbent upon the Government to await its outcome. Was the plan to present a fait accompli that would be difficult to reverse?'  The Constitutional Conduct Group

The signatories demanded that the government review the Central Vista project entirely. 'We strongly believe that the project should not be implemented, particularly at this time,' they said. 'However, even if the government decides to go ahead in principle, the project must be subjected to critical scrutiny by citizens and independent experts, plans must be redrawn to make them compatible with environmental and heritage conservation standards and the due processes of law relating to such projects must be followed.'

On December 10, Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building. He said that the new building will be a landmark of India's democracy.

Congress and other Opposition parties, on the other hand, questioned the timing and need of the building amid the pandemic and the farmers' protest against the Centre's three agricultural laws.

Despite the groundbreaking ceremony, the new Parliament will not be built immediately as the government on December 7 assured the Supreme Court that it would not carry out any construction, demolition or felling of trees in the Central Vista area for now. This came after the top court had expressed displeasure at the government 'aggressively' continuing with the redevelopment project while petitions challenging the project were yet to be decided.

The government's Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project is aimed at making changes to Parliament and the ministries over the course of four years. The project has been criticised for its huge cost. There have also been concerns that it will cause the destruction of national heritage. The Supreme Court, however, is only hearing petitioners and Centre on a limited aspect related to change in land use.

1104, https://scroll.in/article/981344/what-modis-central-vista-plan-says-about-his-vision-of-a-new-india ,"A majestic sweep of red sandstone buildings housing government ministries overlooking manicured green lawns and an avenue slicing its way to a lonely war monument. To its left is Parliament House (shaped like a wheel on its side), stately administrative buildings and the National Archives. This landscape of restrained opulence  known as the Central Vista  was designed by the British when they decided to move their imperial headquarters from Calcutta costto Delhi in 1911.

It seems to reach further back, however, drawing its monumental presence from a hoary, indeterminate past and projecting it into the eternal future, a timeless performance of power.

In all likelihood, this historic, internationally renowned architectural panorama will look very different by the time India's 75th anniversary in August 2022 rolls around if the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to redesign it goes ahead as planned.

The Rs 971-crore project was green-lighted recently by the housing ministry amid widespread consternation. Urban planners, architects, designers, artists, journalists, scholars and politicians deplored the extravagance amidst a pandemic and alleged favouritism in the choice of a consultant and raged against the government's cavalier approach to history and aesthetics.

The liberal intelligentsia does not trust Narendra Modi. The mistrust can be traced back to 2002 when mass attacks killed over a thousand Muslims in Gujarat where Modi, a member of the militant Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, was chief minister. The riots pointed to a bleak future for India's secular ethos in the event of a full-fledged majoritarian dispensation.

That prediction was put to a test in 2014 when Modi, repackaged as a hyper-capitalist moderniser by a Rs 714.28-crore election campaign, stormed the national ballot. The national media claimed that he had left his divisive past behind him and had worked a developmental miracle in Gujarat, a phenomenon it termed the 'Gujarat Model'.

Any hope that the liberal intelligentsia may have drawn from this turn has been belied by Modi's performance as prime minister. The economy has weakened while a controversial amendment to the Citizenship Act has been passed accompanied by continued attacks on Muslims, lower caste Hindus, human rights activists and students.

Sensitive Indians are appalled by the widespread and avoidable suffering caused by Modi's proclivity for dramatic announcements, such as an overnight demonetisation and a sudden lockdown, which sent India's cash-reliant economy into a tailspin and caused thousands of migrants living in cities to walk hundreds of miles to their home villages.

Astute political analysts are thrown by Modi's arbitrary and unpredictable diktats, which include immensely significant decisions, such as revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status within the Indian Constitution. Modi's effusiveness in greeting foreign leaders, his love for the media glare and his penchant for buying bullet trains and building gigantic statues have provoked ridicule.

The Central Vista project had one commentator comparing him to a mid-20th century African autocrat with a vanity project. Another compared him to Mungerilal, a 1980s Indian television soap opera character based on the chronic daydreamer, Walter Mitty.

A picture emerges of a fanatical, capricious and megalomaniacal leader. A self-aggrandising man who is so consumed by bigotry that it is impossible to know what he will do next. It is a compelling image but it is a myth.

I say this because I spent many years observing Modi when he was chief minister in his home state. As a frequent visitor to Gujarat in the early 2000s, I noticed that in its preoccupation with the mass violence of 2002 and the ensuing judicial processes, the national media was unaware of other significant events in the state.

First was the deep and unusual consensus of hostility rather than empathy among local Hindus towards Muslim riot victims. Second was the way Modi had leveraged the fraught post-riot environment to garner support across communities in the entrepreneurial state for a fast-track development effort concentrated on Gujarat's commercial capital, Ahmedabad.

Every few months I found that something new  a luxury hotel, a convention centre, roads, a highway  had been added. A modest city was remodelled into a mega-metropolis and a site for attracting investment through a splashy biannual summit under the tagline 'Vibrant Gujarat'.

I sensed that these phenomena had national implications and I was proved right when Modi surged to power at the Centre in 2014 on the basis of his achievements in Gujarat. The problem was that nobody understood what exactly Modi had done in Gujarat or how well it explained his current game plan for India.

A new India

Since 1991, when India adopted capitalist reforms, there has been a promise in the air of a new India, a country equipped with the infrastructure, material opportunities and consumer goods of the developed world. Eager Indians have looked forward to surging riches and cities with the gleam of Shanghai and Singapore, the promised fruits of an accelerated urbanisation programme that has a wide and uncontested acceptance across the political spectrum.

The absence of a palpable concern for the high human cost of restructuring in a poor country like India testifies to the blinding appeal of these material aspirations. Or perhaps it is the malleable nature of Indian politics and the responsiveness of politicians tno pulls and pressures (a quality deplored for slowing down change but critical in a democracy) that have led thoughtful voters to assume that an incremental process would find ad hoc solutions along the way.

However, Narendra Modi is not a conventional Indian politician. In fact, he is not a politician at all. He is an ideologue. He is committed to the ideology of the RSS. And he is committed to neoliberalism. And he is committed to both at the same time. The binary created in 2014 by the media that claimed that Modi had relinquished his divisive past to embrace development is a false one. The two are not contradictory but symbiotic.

To explain this amalgam I need to say a little about Modi's developmental strategy in Gujarat. The media in 2014, in its superficial understanding of what it called the 'Gujarat Model', painted a picture of a high-growth neoliberal model (albeit with poor indices on conventional measures, such as health and nutrition).

Had the media done a more in-depth study or looked at available scholarship on the subject, it would have found that the phenomenon they were touting was not a random collection of developmental projects but facets of a highly-evolved process used all over the world by neoliberalising economies.

Place marketing is a process of making spaces, particularly cities, attractive to people and companies with money to spend, particularly transnational corporations, business travellers and tourists. A number of strategies are associated with the process, the most common of which is gentrification. Airports are made over, cities are beautified, special business enclaves and recreational areas with nightclubs and caf�s spring up.

There are several other strategies that cities use to market themselves, including staging large cultural events, developing historical enclaves to attract tourists or fostering a service or industrial specialisation. Ahmedabad was imagined as a centre for medical tourism and its old walled city was refurbished to bid for UNESCO World Heritage certification. Indeed one can find every place marketing strategy represented in the city as if someone had ticked off a list in a textbook.

Neoliberalism, which targets developmental activities at moneyed sections of society in the expectation that the benefits will 'trickle down' to the deprived masses, is a highly iniquitous form of development. In societies across the world, it has also been noticed that neoliberalism's adverse effects are felt most strongly by those lower down the social ladder. The RSS's goal of privileging Hindus fits in well with the hierarchical arrangement. Modi's innovation was to insert a feature of the RSS agenda into every opportunity thrown up by the makeover effort.

So in a city where the 2002 riots had seen Muslims from mixed areas relocate to ghettos on the margins, a new High Street emerged, bursting with malls, multiplexes, restaurants and replicas of Hindu temples from every part of the country.

An artificial lake built by a 15th-century sultan and frequented by the poor labouring class metamorphosed into a walled pay-and-use leisure space with a toy train running around the periphery. In a city where Gandhi, an advocate of non-violence and a b�te noire of militant Hinduism, had his most visited ashram, a heritage walk described a legacy of violence in the freedom struggle. Even the city's name underwent a spelling change to rid it of its Islamic associations.

Scaling up the model

It is a hard argument to push in a country obsessed with personalities and electoral battles, but here it is: Modi is not a 20th-century despot but a contemporary leader like Turkey's Erdogan and Brazil's Bolsonaro. His thinking is not arbitrary but formulaic. It can be summed up as: place marketing conflated with RSS goals against the backdrop of neoliberalism and a narrative combining stigmatisation with hyperbole. Though varying situations and opportunities may throw up qualitatively differing outcomes, the formula remains the organising principle.

Viewed through this lens, various phenomena, such as Modi's frequent foreign visits, his 'Make in India' and similar campaigns to encourage manufacturing activities, and his passion for the bullet train (a shiny symbol of speed) are activities easily associated with a place marketing exercise.

All his political moves and programmes, including demonetisation, schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana to expand the reach of banking and even huge political leaps, such as the move on Jammu and Kashmir, become steps (ordering, enumerating, expanding opportunity, extending the formal economy) in a project of neoliberal transformation. Some borrow directly from Gujarat: the 2014 Swachh Bharat extended the logic of a 1997-1998 United States Agency for International Development programme in Ahmedabad to improve hygiene and create green spaces to aid the circulation of capital and healthy labour.

The relentless violence and aggression that have marked Modi's prime ministership are not ends in themselves but tactical manoeuvres to accelerate the process of economic restructuring by distracting or deflecting potential opposition, as well as creating a miasma of fear that empowers Modi to restructure with minimal blowback. Modi's majoritarian inclinations are an essential component of the process but their main vehicle is not the sporadic bursts of violence but more enduring forms made possible by the project of remaking.

Configuring urban space

Urban space and architecture have a critical role to play in place marketing. In recent times, cities have vied to attract attention by building the biggest, shiniest, tallest or most eye-catching structures. Kaula Lumpur's Petronas Towers (the world's tallest building when it was built) was showcased by the Malaysian government in a 1999 Fox film starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones as a form of 'state-sponsored architectural nationalism'. The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, billed as Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel when it was launched in 2000, attracts 3.75 million visitors annually.

Modi is drawn to scale. Publicity material for the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City on the banks of the Sabarmati in Ahmedabad claimed it would be twice the size of Paris' La Defense and eight times more built up than the London docklands. Nearby Surat is building the world's 'largest diamond bourse'. Modi's pet project as prime minister, a Statue of Unity that is 182 metres high and a tourist attraction, is another instance of a project defined by place marketing canons. The statue, which is of Sardar Patel, India's first Deputy Prime Minister, and a favourite of the Hindu Right, also demonstrates perfectly Modi's habit of conflating a neoliberal aim with a majoritarian one.

This sort of conflation, while integral to Modi's vision, is not unknown in place marketing efforts in other parts of the world. In South-East Asia, for instance, amidst the glossiness of skyscrapers, parks, waterways and convention centres, the 'post-colonial enterprise of cultivating national identity and promoting national pride remains highly salient', according to urban scholar BSA Yeoh. It can be seen in the incorporation of Asian elements like the Hindu mandala and Chinese ideas of Feng Shui, Yin-and-Yang and in other more subtle ways that promote the conjoined values of entrepreneurialism, consumerism and nationalism.

Framed against this backdrop, the Central Vista project does not emerge as a maverick's vanity project but as a symbolic assertion of a new idea of India that draws not only from religious triumphalism but also, and importantly, from multiple well-funded programmes of urban regeneration and the immense hunger for an India that is dressed in the superficial glamour of the West. Housing ministry officials who talk about replacing historical buildings with 'world-class' infrastructure speak from a script that acknowledges that the 'global', as PF Kelly points out, 'has become an icon or a spatial metaphor'¦with considerable political power'.

By ignoring the socio-cultural impact of economic policy shifts both globally and in post-liberalisation India, and focusing exclusively on conventional politics, the Indian liberal intelligentsia is failing to mount a meaningful critique of the contemporary Indian political scenario, thus presenting Modi with the opportunity of a fait accompli.

'Thousands of people died in the construction of the Great Wall of China,' Haasan wrote in a tweet. 'The kings said that this wall was to protect the people. When half of India is starving after losing its livelihood due to the coronavirus, why build a Parliament worth Rs 1,000 crore? To protect whom are you building the new Parliament? Please reply, my honourable elected Prime Minister.'

Haasan's tweet came hours before he launched his party Makkal Needhi Maiam's campaign for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, PTI reported. He said the focus of his campaign would be the complete transformation of Tamil Nadu.

'There is no doubt about degeneration in the state... people know that well and there is no point lamenting MNM [Makkal Needhi Maiam] will talk about what needs to be done now,' Haasan was quoted as saying by the news agency.

He invoked Guru Nanak to emphasise the importance of dialogue, perhaps as a nod to the Sikh farmers protesting at the edges of the capital. He referred to instances from 10th and 12th century India to make a case for a native tradition of democracy, apparently older than the version adapted from the West. Democracy was a culture in India, a way of life and the soul of the nation, said the prime minister, in a ceremony whose circumstances and impulses were decidedly undemocratic.

Modi was addressing an audience of ministers and select industrialists. Most of the Opposition had steered clear of a ceremony that went ahead in the midst of a pandemic and farmer protests that are an indictment of how India's parliamentary democracy has performed in recent times.

It also went ahead despite several lawsuits against the Central Vista project, of which the new Parliament building is a key component. The Supreme Court allowed the ceremony but stayed all construction or demolition before it decided on petitions against the project. But the ebullience of the prime minister's speech, and the 2022 deadline for completing the building, suggests lawsuits are trivial pursuits. They are bound to be decided in favour of this grand edifice to 'New India'.

Finally, a 'bhumi pujan' was performed to consecrate the foundation of the new 'temple of democracy'. While an interfaith prayer was said, the religious rituals of the majority dominated the service. Why exactly did the new Parliament of a secular state begin life with religious rituals in the first place?

Down with the old

The old Parliament building has long been absorbed into the iconography of Indian democracy, its images printed on bank notes and flashed on television screens by Doordarshan before the daily news broadcast. Independent India took colonial structures, it is argued, and made them its own.

It is true that the Parliament building and central vista of Lutyens's Delhi are steeped in histories of injustice that are often elided in the national narrative; consider the 150 villages erased to make way for the new imperial capital in the early 20th century. It may also be up for discussion whether the grand urban axis  a legacy of empire, aimed at impressing upon citizens the terror and awe of the state  best represents a modern democracy.

But these matters were never up for discussion. There was little public or parliamentary debate about the new central vista project. Constitutional guidelines were bypassed, heritage laws were twisted, land use and environmental guidelines were shrugged off to push it through in just a few months. The Central Public Works Department, presiding over the Central Vista Committee despite a conflict of interest, gave a 'no objection' certificate despite 1,200 recorded objections from citizens. Tenders were rushed through in a secretive process.

While the new Parliament building is to cost Rs 971 crore, the entire redevelopment project, which will reconfigure central Delhi, is an estimated Rs 20,000 crore in public funds. It makes for especially bad optics right now. The country is reeling from an economic crisis and farmers protest against laws they fear will leave them at the mercy of corporates. The capital chokes on the annual winter smog, fed by stubble burning and construction dust. Fast tracking the project now has a distinct Nero fiddled while Rome burned bravado to it.

Hurry up with the new

It has been argued that India needs a bigger building to house more parliamentarians in an increasingly populous democracy. But delimitation, which will drive up the number of representatives, is not until 2026. The Centre's hurry to complete the building by 2022, in time to commemorate 75 years of Independence, speaks of this government's fetish for monumentalisation.

Statues of iron men, temples on the site of desecrated mosques, renamed roads  these are the many ways in which Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has tried to remould the national imaginary. Now, the Parliament building will be cast in the image of 'New India', Modi claimed. But, given the lack of public participation and debate, it may well be in the image of Modi and his government.","At ceremony for new Parliament building, Modi spoke of democracy  to cover up the absence of it",12,2020

In a speech after the ceremony, Modi said that the building will be a landmark of India's democratic tradition.

The prime minister also highlighted the importance of the Parliament in India's history. 'The first session of Parliament of independent India was held in this very building,' Modi said, referring to the old building. 'Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others drafted our Constitution in the Central Hall.'

He said that the new building was the need of the hour as it would be equipped with new technology and have more space for smooth functioning of Parliament and various ministries. 'It would be a matter of great pride for the country to have a new Parliament building in 2022, the 75th year of our Independence,' the prime minister said.

Asserting that Indian democratic traditions predate the Magna Carta, a 13th century document many scholars consider as the framework for a modern republic, the prime minister said that the day is not far when the world would term India the 'mother of democracy' if Indians extol the country's democratic history with confidence.

He added that the building was an example of co-existence of the new with the old. 'If the old Parliament building gave direction to India after independence, the new building would be a witness to the making of an 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' [self-reliant India],' Modi said.

He noted that India's democracy was a system developed through centuries of experience. Modi added that usually, when democracy is discussed elsewhere, it is about election procedures, governance and administration, but in India, it was a value and a way of life.

Modi asserted that democracy in India has always been a means of resolving differences along with governance. 'Different views and different perspectives empower a vibrant democracy,' he noted.

Modi urged everyone to take the pledge that there would be no greater interest for them than national interest and that their concern for the country would be more than their personal concerns.

He said many new things were being incorporated in the new Parliament House, which will increase the efficiency of MPs, and modern methods would be incorporated in the work culture.

Earlier during the day, Modi performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the building. Priests from the Sringeri Math Karnataka did the rituals for the 'bhoomi pujan' at the new Parliament building site, according to PTI.

The event that was attended by leaders from various political parties, cabinet ministers and ambassadors of different countries. Ratan Tata, whose Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament building in September, was also present.

The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. It will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.

In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while the Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The Lok Sabha chamber will have an option to increase its sitting capacity to 1,224 members during joint sessions. This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.

However, work for the construction cannot begin immediately after the ceremony as the government on Monday assured the Supreme Court that it would not carry out any construction, demolition or felling of trees in the Central Vista area for now.

The ceremony for the new Parliament building will take place on Thursday.

In a short letter to Modi, the chief minister said the project was 'long overdue' as the existing government infrastructure in the national Capital was inadequate and associated with the country's colonial past.

'I join you with a sense of pride on the occasion of laying of the foundation stone for the grand project of Central Vista,' Rao, popularly known as KCR, wrote in his letter. 'The new Central Vista project will be a symbol of self-esteem, prestige and national pride of a resurgent, confident and strong India. I wish for the speedy completion of this prestigious and nationally important project.'

Opposition parties and former civil servants have severely criticised the Narendra Modi government for not cutting down on 'luxuries' like the Central Vista project amid the coronavirus crisis. The Rs 20,000-crore venture aims to build a new Parliament and other central government offices in Lutyens' Delhi. The government has justified its decision to build a new Parliament building, saying that the current one was 'showing signs of distress and over-use'.

It has also been challenged in the Supreme Court, with petitioners opposing the proposed change in land usage of the Central Vista, the iconic boulevard of approximately 3.5 km from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, and further to the National Stadium. They have argued that it is a symbol of India's historic past, its nationhood, its vibrant democracy.

On Monday, a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, had expressed displeasure with the Centre for 'aggressively' continuing with the construction, demolition and shifting of trees even as questions concerning the legality of the Central Vista project were being heard in the court. He, however, allowed the foundation stone laying ceremony to go ahead as scheduled.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had assured that no physical changes would be made to the area. 'We thought we are dealing with a prudent litigant and deference will be shown,' the court had told Mehta. 'We have shown deference to you and expected that you will act in a prudent manner. The same deference should be shown to the court and there should be no demolition or construction.'","Central Vista project is a 'symbol of national pride, strong India,' Telangana CM writes to PM Modi",9,2020

The court also rebuked the government for 'moving forward aggressively' on the project even before a decision was given on the petitions challenging it.

A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar heard a petition against the Centre's Central Vista project and the government's proposal to construct a new Parliament in Lutyens Delhi.

'You can lay the foundation stone, you can carry on paperwork but no construction or demolition, no cutting down any trees,' the Supreme Court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. 'We have shown deference to you and expected that you will act in a prudent manner. The same deference should be shown to the [Supreme] Court and there should be no demolition or construction.'

Mehta accepted the court's directive on behalf of the central government. 'I can make a statement that there will be no construction, demolition or felling of trees,' he said. 'Foundation stone will be laid. But, no physical change.'

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday announced that Modi will lay the foundation stone and perform 'Bhoomi Pujan' for the new Parliament building on December 10. The Speaker, who is the custodian of the Parliament building, extended a formal invitation to Modi for the ceremony.

'We started the journey of independent India in the old building, and when we complete 75 years, we will have the session of both Houses in the new Parliament building,' Birla had told reporters. 'It will not be a building of bricks and stones, it will be the fulfilment of the dreams of 130 crore people.'

Birla had said that the building will have sitting capacity for 1,224 MPs, for joint sessions, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the Houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan. The existing Parliament building, the Speaker said, will be conserved as an archaeological asset of the country.

The Big Story: Foundational challenge

On December 10, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building in Delhi.

It might seem odd for the Political Fix to focus on what sounds like a fairly ordinary government photo-op on the same week that Modi will face a Bharat Bandh, a national strike, despite several rounds of talks with protesting farmer groups that have been demanding the repeal of agricultural laws passed two months ago (see last Monday's issue for more on this).

The protests  partially blockading the roads leading into Delhi  have only grown more significant, as revealed by the government's willingness to discuss amendments to the law to address the farmers' concerns. The Indian Express reports that the government is even considering a special Parliament session to pass amendments, though the farmers have maintained their demand for a full repeal.

The government's potential backtracking is reminiscent of its retreat from an attempt to alter pro-business land acquisition laws in Modi's first term, a moment widely seen as part of the government's pivot towards a more welfarist narrative that eventually helped it win a massive re-election in 2019.

It has yet to commit to any changes, but the fact that it is even in talks with the farmer groups stands in stark contrast to the government's attitude towards the protests against the Citizenship Act amendments passed in 2019. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets to protest the discriminatory law around the country, only to be deemed anti-national by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which unleashed police brutality against protesters in many cases.

So why are we discussing the laying of a foundation stone for a building instead?

Because of what is different about the new Parliament.

Leave aside questions of whether this is the right time for Modi's amibitious and expensive Central Vista revamp, which aims to reconstruct the heart of India's government in New Delhi to reflect his time in power. Never mind also the allegations of impropriety in awarding the contract for a new Parliament to the Tata Group, which were later withdrawn by a rival corporate house.

Full house

One key detail about the new building, as PTI reported: 'In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house membersAt present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.'

If the Lok Sabha only has 543 members, why does its new chamber need 888 seats?

One answer, presumably, is the intention to allow the Lok Sabha to also host a full joint session, when members of both India's upper and lower houses of Parliament sit together. This is done on special occasions, either to mark a significant date or in the case of an address by a visiting dignitary.

But joint sittings can also be called when there is a deadlock in terms of legislation between the two houses, usually allowing the party or coalition with larger support in the Lok Sabha to pass a bill  as has happened on less than a handful of occasions in the past.

The more relevant reason for the Lok Sabha to have more seats is simply that there are likely to be more Lok Sabha members.

The Indian Constitution permits a maximum of 552 Lok Sabha MPs. But the state-wise allocation of seats was supposed to be adjusted every 10 years based on population changes, in such a way that each Member of Parliament would represent roughly an equal number of people, not counting Union Territories or particularly small states.

That represented a problem particularly in the 1970s, when population control was an official objective of the Indian government. If seats were re-allocated as per the set formula, states where the population grew faster would be rewarded with more Lok Sabha MPs, while states that were successfully implementing the state policy of population control would effectively be penalised and lose seats.

'Malapportionment'

To address this, the number of seats was frozen in 1976, with the aim of revisiting the matter after the 2001 census. In 2002, the delimitation exercise  the term used for re-evaluating constituencies  was again pushed off to 2026, now fast approaching, though it might have to wait until after the 2031 census.

From a democratic point of view, this is problematic, since it means that every Member of Parliament from Tamil Nadu represents on average 1.8 million citizens, whereas an MP From Uttar Pradesh represents 3 million  effectively increasing or decreasing the value of a vote depending on where you live.

Side note: Fascinatingly, Milan Vaishnav and Jamie Hintson found that despite 1.2 million fewer citizens on average per constituency in Tamil Nadu than Uttar Pradesh, the number of registered voters were about the same. Even more remarkably, more voters actually voted per constituency in Tamil Nadu than Uttar Pradesh.

However, from a political economy point of view, this postponement of the problem for 50 years is also challenging because, whenever the numbers are adjusted they will lead to a remarkable shift in power  which broadly breaks down on a North/South axis.

This table, from an analysis by Vaishnav and Hintson in 2019 shows you just how much things would change.

Based on 2011 census numbers, 'four north Indian states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh) would collectively gain 22 seats, while four southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) would lose 17 seats', the analysis concluded. 'Based on our population projections, these trends will only intensify as time goes on. In 2026, for instance, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh alone stand to gain 21 seats while Kerala and Tamil Nadu would forfeit as many as 16.'

As we saw in the debate over how the 15th Finance Commission ought to distribute taxes, South Indian states will vigorously fight efforts to undercut their political or economic power simply because their fertility rates came down over the last 50 years.

At the same time, even if it reflects a failure of their governments on an official policy objective, should citizens in North Indian states be penalised, politically and economically, because their population growth remained high?

Instead of taking away seats from some states and giving them to others to solve the problem, academically called 'malapportionment', one of the proposed solutions has been to simply follow what was done in the 1950s and 1960s and increase the total number of seats, giving more to the states with larger populations.

Fuller House

This would still lead to a major change in power within the Lok Sabha, since North Indian states will have many more seats than before, but at least no state would have to lose representatives. It would need a Constitutional Amendment, since there is a 550-seat upper-limit at the moment, but that might be an easier task to achieve than taking away seats from a state.

Vaishnav and Hintson put together a map of what this might look like, taking projected population figures in 2026 as the basis:

The result: A Lok Sabha of 848 seats, not far from the 888 that the new Parliament building is making space for.

Narendra Modi's large Parliamentary majorities have given him the foundation to alter the shape of the Indian Union  as with the unilateral stripping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, or the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax before that  in ways that previous prime ministers were unwilling or unable to.

But his centralising tendencies and tendency to bulldoze policies, as we have noted over and over again on this newsletter, will make states especially in the South deeply suspicious of any effort to alter their position within the Indian Union.

Of course, the 2026 changes would come after the next Parliamentary elections, but if anything the BJP has made it clear how it is willing to embark on projects that are decades in the making. With the likelihood  as reflected by the new Parliament building  that Modi and the BJP plan to eventually follow through on the redistribution of seats and the understanding that the delimitation question cannot be put off forever, it is imperative that a public dialogue about how best to resolve this matter begin in earnerst.

Or else it may play out just as demonetisation or Article 370 did, with a party with majority at the Centre taking a massively significant move without consultation with either the Opposition or the public at large.

As economist Ajit Ranade has argued:

'We may desire 'equality' of constituencies, but economic development and demographic patterns do not develop uniformly across the country. Some states have achieved zero population growth while others still have very high fertility rates. This pattern too has a north-south dimension. It is as if the economic centre of gravity is shifting south and the political centre of gravity is shifting north



It is not too early to begin addressing the issue of delimitation at the national level Just as the nation took more than 12 years to come to a consensus on 'one nation one tax' (i.e. the roll-out of the goods and services tax), a national consensus exercise should be started to sort out issues much before 2026.'

This structure will be a part of the mega Central Vista redevelopment project and a realisation of the 'new India' vision, the government said.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said in statement that the Central Public Works Department will hold a competition 'to crowd-source implementable ideas for the conceptual architectural and structural design' of the structure.

The structure will be part of the New India Garden, which is proposed to come up on the Yamuna's western bank the western bank of Yamuna. It is likely to be completed by August 15, 2022.

The Centre said that structure will be symbol of the new India. ''��The iconic structure is planned to realize the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, symbolizing emerging New India with equitable growth opportunities, rooted in values of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas [development for all, with everyone's trust] and representing the aspiration of clean India, free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism,' the government said.

'The iconic structure should represent values and aspirations of New India, which is clean and free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism, and casteism,' the Centre said. 'It may further symbolize the new developments like digital India, skilled India, fit India, etc coupled with energy, dynamism and transformational ethos.'

The central government submitted that the decision to have a new Parliament building was taken with careful consideration, and no law or norms had been violated for the project. The new building is required as several occupants have hinted at inadequacies in the existing one.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, opposed the pleas raised about environmental clearance and said that all the ministries at one place would increase efficiency and ensure better coordination. He further added that the existing building was not earthquake-proof.

'The current building was built in 1927 prior to Independence and was intended to house the legislative council and not a bicameral legislature we have today,' Mehta said, according to Bar and Bench. 'The building does not conform to fire safety norms and water and sewer lines are also haphazard which is damaging the heritage nature of the building.'

Mehta also noted security concerns, citing the 2001 Parliament attack. On December 13, 2001, five heavily armed gunmen stormed Parliament and opened fire. All five attackers were shot dead.

The Solicitor General also said that the Centre decided to redevelop the project in the location as the Parliament and the Central Secretariat should be built in a historically significant place. 'These cannot (therefore) be built at Gurgaon, Panipat or Noida,' Mehta said. 'It has to be at Central Vista.'

The deadline for the construction of the building was set as 2022, and the project has been treated as a standalone one which means that it can be done even if the rest of the project is scrapped. 'The police decision was to build all these [new buildings] without touching the existing heritage properties,' Mehta said, 'Not a brick of existing buildings will be touched.'

The Centre is also planning to convert the existing Parliament building into a museum. The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, will hear the matter on Wednesday.

Hence, they will not be considered for protection provided to heritage buildings.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta presented to the court an affidavit in this regard filed by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation. Mehta presented arguments in defence of the Centre's action to approve change of land use for the Central Vista project.

'Only the Rajpath along with the green lawns and the water bodies on either side is designated as the Central Vista Precinctsthis does not include any other offices located at Central Vista,' the affidavit said. It added that buildings such as Nirman Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Rail Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vayu Bhawan, etc cannot be termed heritage buildings as they are not in the list notified by the Centre in 2009.

Mehta however also told the court that Central Vista Precincts comprising Rajpath, along with the green lawns and water bodies on either side, will remain untouched in the proposed Central Vista Project. He said that the project will not hinder public access to the non-heritage buildings.

The court was hearing a batch of petitions that opposed the hurried manner in which the Centre gave approvals for the project. The petitioners said that the Parliament and surrounding structures have been classified as heritage structures and cannot be destroyed. The petitioners had also expressed their concern that once the new buildings are constructed, public access to the Rajpath, the adjoining lawns and nearby areas will be closed off.

The Central Vista Project has met with several objections. However, the court is only hearing petitioners and Centre on a limited aspect related to change in land use.

Many of us carry mental, emotional, and oftentimes, physical scars from either fearing or encountering the ever-present undercurrent of gendered violence. The unpredictability of this violence, emerging from spaces that may seem unthreatening on the surface, makes it all the more unnerving.

For all intents and purposes, Delhi's women are equal citizens of the capital of the world's largest democracy  free to occupy its streets, parks, public transport and urban spaces. Yet we know it is not so. Born of experience, we all have mental maps, alarm bells, dress codes, time zones and a sixth sense to navigate the city's socio-spatial danger traps. We internalise this knowledge to avoid spaces and situations that might be 'asking for it'. We manage ourselves and manage our expectations of what a modern city should feel like for women, normalising a violent premise that the city is not just to be inhabited, but survived, by women's bodies.

The privileged few among us try and keep to our 'safe' cocoons  we stay in gated communities, travel by private vehicles, work in gated compounds, and pretend that we are safe in our barbed-wire bubbles. But even those of us who can afford gated safety know it is a fragile illusion. Shut your eyes for a minute and imagine that you, or a woman you know, finds herself on a lonely stretch in Delhi, cut off from all familiar safe spaces, communication, or transport, especially in the late evening  and the city starts feeling like a nightmare episode of Into the Wild. I know, because finding myself in a similar situation when I was 18 resulted in a brutal assault from which my broken bones never fused back to normal again.

Delhi records the highest number of crimes against women among 19 Indian metros according to the National Crime Records Bureau, single-handedly accounting for an astounding 41% of such cases in 2018. This violence is often met with reactionary or resigned platitudes, rather than a sustained engagement with underlying structural issues.

Among these often-ignored structural issues are urban planning and design. The research consensus in the field is that socio-spatial conditions generated by urban design and planning have enormous implications for gender-inclusive cities. In a city that routinely tops crime against women statistics in the country, urban projects need to urgently prioritise gender issues. In this light, the Central Vista Project  a proposed Rs 20,000 crore, top-down redevelopment of the iconic precinct that stretches from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, including the seminal built structures of the Indian Republic from the Parliament house to North and South Block  is extremely significant.

What the Central Vista project is all about

The Central Vista project is one of the most important urban projects not just for Delhi but nationally. Its high national profile makes it one of the rare projects with the potential to alter expectations of what urban public projects in India can deliver. Its priorities and omissions have symbolic value far beyond the physical space it occupies.

The project has two key components, one of which is proposing a massive new Parliament next to the older Parliament building, in effect stripping the original structure  in whose halls our Independence was formally announced and our Constitution was enshrined  of its defining function, without any meaningful public consultation. The second key component involves lining both sides of Rajpath, beyond the greens, with repetitive multi-story blocks of government offices. To achieve this, the government is changing the prescribed land use of 80 acres of land from existing public, recreational or green use to government use.

Stripping the Central Vista of its public uses and turning Delhi's heart into a fortified mass of buildings for politicians and bureaucrats has implications for Delhi's ongoing crises of violence against women. To understand how, we need to first understand two urban planning issues at the heart of how spaces enable violence in Delhi, and the larger National Capital Region, that draws inspiration from it.

'Eyes on the street'

The first issue concerns the street edge condition  how built and open spaces interact in the city. Unlike say Mumbai or Kolkata, where the life of buildings spills out into the streets and vice versa, New Delhi, built after the shock of the first war of Independence, is marked by imperial standoffishness and fear of subjects. Its buildings lie far back from the accountability of streets, barricaded and walled-off or 'setback', as this gated built form became formalised in post-Independence planning. With little street life, the tree-lined motorways are quite isolated, feeling and often turning unsafe.

The second aspect is that of land use. The Old City's traditional mixed-use spaces had given way to the 'single' or exclusive use spaces of Lutyens Delhi, which were carried forward by subsequent planning decisions in Independent India. Land use is the legal use of different plots of land with categories such as residential, commercial, recreational, industrial and more, as prescribed by the Delhi Master Plan. Generation after generation in Delhi has flouted these single use strictures to mix homes with shops, offices, parlours and more. In fact, much of the economic life of the city is concentrated in zones that refuse single-use strictures for vibrant mixed-use purposes.

Yet, the city administration persists with the illusion of control, through neatly labelled land use categories, deeming the natural and diverse means of organising urban space in the city 'illegal' or 'encroachments'. Ironically it is these very 'unplanned' areas of Delhi  urban villages, Old City areas of Shahjahanabad, and the numerous self-built 'illegal' colonies  that often provide pockets of respite to women through safer, more vibrant, user-generated street and community life even late into the evening.

Newer, formally planned areas, on the other hand, like Okhla Industrial Area were conceived almost exclusively for industrial land use. In the evening, as the workforce empties out, this huge precinct with entire blocks of built infrastructure becomes an abandoned ghost town.

Though subsequent master plans for Delhi have allowed for more mixed land use, including in Okhla, decades of planning practices have drained much of the city of the intimacy of diverse users and uses. With the exception of a few celebrated spots like Lodhi Gardens, or Sunder Nursery, many of Delhi's large green spaces remain forbidding for unaccompanied women. Planned with little consideration for women's safety, the edges of these empty commons meet long stretches of desolate roads.

Delhi's main spine, the Ring Road, is especially infamous. Here, speed combines with long-isolated stretches, encouraging perpetrators in cars, 'to rape until the fuel runs out', in the words of one planning expert quoted in the New York Times. Badly planned urban space has become a setting, a tool, and an accomplice for predators.

What colonial Delhi and its subsequent post-Independence urban planning lacks is the 'eyes on the street' advantage of mixed-use, street-front urban settings. The 'eyes on the street' approach was part of the core qualities propounded by celebrated planner and thinker Jane Jacobs, crucial to successful urban public spaces, where, 'The buildings on a street equipped to handle strangers and to ensure the safety of both residents and strangers, must be oriented to the street. They cannot turn their backs or blank sides on it and leave it blind.'

Designing safe cities

Planning that brings people out and encourages interaction through diverse uses across day and night makes us take collective guardianship of each other's safety, though shared ownership of the spaces we occupy. Diverse public uses, ease of public access, and public participation become the anchors around which safe cities are designed.

The Central Vista project, on the other hand, usurps the most important public, green and recreational sites of the city, and in an unprecedented land use change seeks to transfer public land use to the state to house the highly fortified government functions. These will need to be barricaded from their surroundings for security purposes. The visuals released of these twin rows of repetitive, identical-looking mega-blocks flanking the much-loved Rajpath vista are reminiscent of Soviet Cold War architecture  not the flexible, diverse, culturally vibrant centres that cities around the world are striving for in 2020.

The project prioritises the nation's most powerful  its bureaucrats and politicians over its people, especially Delhi's citizens. The parks lining Rajpath might get some cosmetic upgradation, but stripped of any public function and barricaded from their high security-built surroundings, they are dependent on policing, not people, for safety. The 'eyes' of this urbanism will be surveillance, not people.

When employed sensitively, urban design can create diverse, safe, and vibrant spatial conditions where chance encounters contain the promise of opportunity, not violence. Spaces that invite people to step out, and open up, not barricade themselves behind walls and guards in a state of normalised siege.

Future visions of the city need to prioritise making the city safe for women  fully half of its population. For the Central Vista, this could have involved removing existing barricades for a fluid interaction between built and unbuilt, using and upgrading existing cultural and public spaces, and introducing a greater diversity of public uses. A multiplicity of incremental and inclusive urban interventions are needed in the city, instead of the current top-down and staggeringly expensive schemes, like Central Vista, that will introduce more 'blank and blind' walls.

Entrenching violence

It is worth highlighting that in this day and age, astoundingly, the Central Vista project is almost exclusively driven by men in leadership roles. Some of them are, in turn, often quoted stating that they are realising the dream of one man. Concerns over violence, and the safety of women, in the context of Delhi's dark history with this, are not even articulated as project priorities. Lacking transparency and public consultation  given the haste of its process, which is almost entirely devoid of women in key decision-making roles  the design outcomes of the Central Vista project have, unsurprisingly, little to offer the women of Delhi.

Colonial Delhi was built to keep subjects at a distance. Post-Independence planning did too little to reverse the disconnect of streets and the public. Women were at a greater disadvantage in the resultant urban conditions, especially as they joined the workforce in increasing numbers. It is unfortunate that in 2020, we are entrenching, rather than dismantling, these deeply problematic urban practices in the Central Vista project. This is all being done, ironically, in the very space where Delhi's citizens broke through all security barricades during the popular uprising for justice for the Delhi gang rape victim, an uprising that helped bring a government to its knees.

I had finished my first year of architecture when I was assaulted. Last year, another close architect friend was assaulted near her home in Delhi. We both picked ourselves up, 20 years apart, and somehow got to safety.

For many of Delhi's women, especially those who are already economically and socially vulnerable, the consequences are far worse. It is time to stop looking away from the impact of urban policy, planning, and design on women's safety in our cities, especially Delhi. This holds true for the humblest of planning projects and more so for the nation's most iconic such as the Central Vista.

Instead the project continues to disregard the foundational connections of its planning priorities with the violence that Delhi begets its women. It is not that urban design and urban violence against women are unrelated. It is just that we have normalised the heavy costs of our willful ignorance on the bodies and psyches of Delhi's women.

A bench, comprised of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, heard a petition claiming that the government had been giving approvals for various construction activities related to the project, despite a pending case in the top court. The petitioner's lawyer added that environmental clearances were recommended for the venture and the top court should stop work on the project.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on the other hand, told the court that there had been no 'overreaching of process' in granting clearances related to the project. He added that the Centre cannot guarantee that there will be no work on the ground.

'Can we restrain authorities from acting as per law?' Khanwilkar said during the hearing. The top court, then, observed that any change made by the authorities at the ground level will be at their own risk. The bench, however, directed the Centre to file a detailed response to the petition seeking a stay on the project by July 3. The next hearing was listed for July 7.

In April, the Supreme Court had refused to pause the government's project, citing that the coronavirus crisis was going to ensure that no work could be done for it. It had then said there was no urgency to take action.

The three-km-long Central Vista project stretches from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. The government's project is aimed at making further changes to Parliament and the ministries over the course of four years. However, there will be no external changes to the Parliament facade.

1119, https://scroll.in/article/964355/centres-rs-20000-crore-central-vista-redevelopment-plan-may-sit-at-odds-with-delhi-heritage-rules ,"The Central Vista is an iconic 3 km stretch in the heart of New Delhi that runs from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. Flanked by large green spaces and containing significant structures such as Parliament, the Secretariat buildings and the National Archives, it is recognised around the world as a striking example of innovative urban planning and architecture.

Not surprisingly, the Central government's plan to redevelop the Central Vista, announced in September 2019, has attracted a flurry of debate. Some people have criticised it as an exercise in vanity, while others have questioned the opaque process that resulted in the project being awarded to a Gujarat-based architecture firm. The destruction of national heritage has also been a recurring theme.

From an economic perspective, the estimated cost of Rs. 20,000 crores is equivalent to 1% of the Centre's purported Covid-19 relief package (and 0.1% of India's GDP). Such economic wastefulness at the taxpayer's expense in building a new Parliament, a bunch of government offices, residences for the prime minister and the vice president could not come at a worse time, making a most persuasive case for the project to be junked.

The redevelopment entails altering some structures and demolishing certain buildings within the Parliament complex, modifying the National Archives and constructing several new buildings along the Central Vista, including residences for the prime minister and vice president, completely altering its layout.

So far, two petitions have filed before the Delhi High Court against the change in land use of plots within the Central Vista. The first petition was abruptly transferred from the High Court to the Supreme Court in 'larger public interest', without being 'a reflection on the proceedings before the High Court, in any manner', according to the top court. But in its order, the Supreme Court did not stay the project. It merely ordered that any steps taken by the authorities during the petition's pendency 'will be subject to the outcome of the proceedings'.

The fate of the second petition was even more dismal  it was rejected on April 30 by the Supreme Court with liberty to the petitioner to amend the first petition. In doing so, the Chief Justice of India remarked, 'During Covid-19 situation, nobody is going to do anything [on the project] and there is no urgency.'

Despite these questions being raised before the judiciary, one significant area remains largely unexplored  the redevelopment being at odds with regulations governing heritage conservation as well as the Indian Constitution. As per a 2009 notification issued by the government of Delhi, the Central Vista Precincts are listed as a Grade I heritage precinct and the North and South Block buildings, the National Archives, Parliament House and Campus as Grade I heritage buildings. Grade I heritage consists of buildings and precincts of national or historic importance, embodying excellence in architectural style, design and aesthetics and which are the prime landmarks of the region.

Arbitrary decisions

The Union Minister for the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, which is overseeing the project through the Central Public Works Department, has attempted to quell initial apprehensions that some of these Grade I heritage structures will be demolished as part of the new plan  but it has not formally said so.

Early reports suggested that the new Parliament building may be built within the existing circular fa�ade. The South Block, which the CPWD in 2013 said was being maintained in 'excellent condition', was in September 2019 declared to not be earthquake safe. Despite this, the project envisages converting these allegedly inadequate Secretariat buildings into museums, indicating the arbitrariness in decision making.

Compared to the provisions applicable in 2009 (when the heritage notification was issued), the criteria for classification as Grade I heritage is unchanged under the Unified Building Byelaws for Delhi 2016 (Unified Byelaws). These are regulations notified under the Delhi Development Act, 1957, governing all building activity in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

The Unified Byelaws state that no intervention shall be permitted in Grade I heritage buildings and precincts 'unless it is necessary in the interest of strengthening and prolonging' their life, and that 'absolutely essential and minimum changes would be allowed', in conformity with the original.

On the face of it, some of the proposed changes appear to be irreconcilable with the Unified Byelaws. Additionally, procedural requirements stipulate that redevelopment or alterations shall not take place without prior permission from the municipal authority, which itself should consult and act as per the advice of the Heritage Conservation Committee.

Prior to granting permission, the Heritage Conservation Committee also has to invite and consider objections from the public. Compliance with these provisions is indispensable, and the status of meeting these requirements must be disclosed by the Central government. It can also be called into question whether any permission granted by the Heritage Conservation Committee is based on consideration of relevant material and whether the public consultation process was duly followed.

Moreover, the 1988 Lutyens Bungalow Zone Guidelines point to separate regulations being applicable for the Central Vista. The CPWD tender for the project (accessed from tenderwizard.com) states that the consultant should adhere to the Lutyens Bungalow Zone Guidelines and the Central Vista Committee Guidelines. The exact nature of the Central Vista regulations and their conformity must be ascertained  previous efforts have resulted in bizarre claims by the CPWD (covered by Scroll.in), from not having a copy of the Central Vista guidelines to claiming that 'there are no written guidelines'.

The approval for the new Parliament building, granted at a meeting of the Central Vista Committee on April 23 during the lockdown, is also highly questionable. This Committee is headed by a functionary of the CPWD, and the agenda was presented for consideration by the CPWD's executive engineer for the project  when none of the non-government representatives could attend, even through video conferencing.

Any approval given at such a meeting smacks of mala fides and makes the CPWD the judge, jury and executioner  violating the principle of natural justice that no one can be a judge in his own cause.

Lastly, it must also be noted that the plan runs contrary to Chapter 10 of the Master Plan for Delhi-2021, which identifies the Central Vista as a 'Heritage Zone' and advocates that it must be conserved. This was briefly touched upon in the second petition rejected by the Supreme Court on April 30. This Master Plan is notified under the Delhi Development Act, 1957, with statutory provisions stipulating compliance of development activity to a notified plan and listing penal consequences for contravention, including against a person acting at the instance of the government.

As the debate about the plan rages, it is also worth turning to the Constitution of India. Article 51-A sets out the fundamental duties of Indian citizens, and Clause (f) states that it shall be the duty of citizens 'to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture'. Though not directly enforceable by Courts, numerous environmental cases have interpreted fundamental duties as casting positive obligations upon the government, extending even to reviewing policy decisions in fit cases.

Even if Article 51-A(f) is deemed to be unenforceable on its own, it can be coupled with the provisions of the Unified Byelaws and other regulations, as well as the fundamental right to life under Article 21. The Supreme Court has recognised that 'life' includes one's culture and heritage, and 'protection of that heritage in its full measure' would fall within Article 21. These observations were made in 1988 in a petition alleging mismanagement of a museum trust. Ultimately, the Supreme Court declined to intervene based on peculiar facts, such as the petition not being filed in public interest but for settling scores between members of the Jaipur royal family  which consideration can be safely ruled out in the present context.

All these are plausible legal contentions that could hobble the project. A combined challenge, calling upon the judiciary to reconcile executive decision-making with these norms, could potentially alter the outcome of the redevelopment.

In conclusion, it must be noted that in 2012, India's delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation submitted a proposal for conferring the status of a World Heritage Site to the city of Delhi, including the Central Vista. These areas were deemed to possess 'Outstanding Universal Value', within the meaning of the UNESCO Convention.

While the second stage of the process was abruptly halted by the Modi government in 2015, the Tentative List of the World Heritage Centre continues to list India's submission  a position backed by the Archaeological Survey of India  leaving room for conversion from the Tentative List to a formal nomination for World Heritage status at a subsequent date.

The Centre would be ill-advised to make haste and irreversibly alter New Delhi's aesthetics. A paradigm shift in outlook cannot possibly be justified merely because the political dispensation in 2012 and is not the same. as the present one. Protecting national heritage must transcend party lines.

Gujarat-based company HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited won the contract in October last year to revamp the Central Vista and Parliament. The three-km-long Central Vista stretches from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. On March 20, the Centre notified the change in land use for the project. The project aimed to redesign the Central Vista by November 2020, with further changes to Parliament and the ministries over the subsequent four years. There will be no external changes to the Parliament facade, Puri had said last year. It is, however, unlikely to meet the deadline because of the ongoing health crisis.

'We are writing this letter to express our grave concerns about the Central Vista Redevelopment Project currently planned in the most iconic heritage precinct of New Delhi,' the retired civil servants wrote. They said that the preliminary permissions and clearances for redevelopment of the Central Vista have already been obtained, despite much opposition from the public and 'innumerable flaws' in the selection procedure.

The signatories said that while the Central Vista was planned and built during British rule, it was 'nurtured, savoured and celebrated' after Independence. They said any changes to the area should keep its history in mind. 'The Central Vista area has been accorded Grade 1 heritage status under the extant Unified Building Bye Laws of Delhi,' the letter said. 'Construction and redesign on the scale planned in the redevelopment project will significantly affect the heritage nature of this precinct, and destroy it irrevocably.'

The retired civil servants also alleged that the redevelopment work will cause a lot of environmental damage. 'This precinct is at the core of the congested capital of Delhi, and acts as the lungs of the city...' they said. 'Constructing a large number of multi-storeyed office buildings, with basements, in this open area will create congestion and irreversibly change and damage the environment.'

The signatories added that the Central Vista is also a recreational space for families, especially in the summer. People will be deprived of 'innocent and inexpensive pleasures', such as enjoying an ice cream at the spot, once the redevelopment is under way.

'Redevelopment approved without Parliamentary debate'

The signatories alleged that the redevelopment was approved because of the superstitious belief that the present Parliament was 'unlucky'. They also claimed that the Narendra Modi-led dispensation intends to leave the impress of a particular leader and government on the architecture of Delhi. No Parliamentary debate or discussion took place before the plan was approved, and no experts were consulted, they said.

'Instead a hastily drafted and inappropriate tender was rushed through in record time to select an architectural firm in what was an extremely flawed process,' the signatories alleged.

The letter said that a larger Parliament building to accommodate more MPs due to population rise may be unnecessary given that India's population is projected to decrease from 2061 onward, according to the Economic Survey. 'Moreover, constructing a second Parliament building in close proximity to the existing one would diminish the existing Parliament building and might even endanger its foundations,' it said.

The letter said that instead, the existing Parliament can be repurposed to meet the requirements of expansion and modernisation, as is the norm for all parliament buildings around the world. It added that no Heritage Assessment Analysis has been done for any of the buildings proposed to be demolished or rebuilt.

'A premise on which the redevelopment of Central Vista is based, appears to be the necessity to concentrate offices of the Central Government in one place,' the former civil servants said. 'This is against the basic tenets of the Master Plan of Delhi which stipulates that no new offices should be built in New Delhi and that efforts should be made to decongest it.'

'Advice from professional bodies ignored'

The letter said that prominent professional bodies like the Council of Architecture, the Indian Institute of Architects, the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, the Institute of Urban Designers India, and the Indian Society of Landscape Architects have written numerous letters to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development with advice on aspects of the redesign plan, but these have been ignored. 'If the institutions meant to safeguard the rights and well-being of people in a democratic country can be so arbitrarily ignored, can India still claim to be a democracy?' it said.

The signatories alleged that clearances of the Environmental Assessment Committee of the Ministry of Environment and the Central Vista Committee are being given despite the matter being sub-judice. These approvals have been pushed through hastily, while the country is in a lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, they alleged.

'Finally, in the post Covid-19 scenario, when enormous funds are required for strengthening the public health system, to provide sustenance to people and to rebuild the economy, taking up a proposal to redesign the entire Central Vista at a cost of at least Rs 20,000 crores, a figure likely to escalate significantly, seems particularly irresponsible,' the letter said. Calling for work on the project to be stopped immediately, the signatories added: 'It seems like Nero fiddling while Rome burns.'

On April 30, the Supreme Court had declined to stay the project, but said that no work can be carried out on it while the coronavirus crisis continued. The project, originally supposed to be completed by November this year, has also been opposed by the Congress party.","Sixty former civil servants write to Narendra Modi, housing ministry opposing Central Vista project",5,2020

Selfie takers had a field day on the rechristened Kartavya Path from the Raisina Hill complex to India Gate which was thrown open to the public on Friday after two years. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

Most of the visitors, especially the youngsters, were busy choosing their favourite spots near the lawns and the newly built bridges on the water bodies looking to get the perfect snap of themselves.

""It's a great place for selfies I must have clicked over a dozen selfies here,"" said a civil service aspirant visiting Central Vista Avenue along with his friends.

As evening descended, the number of visitors surged. People took a stroll along the entire stretch and halted at the India Gate complex for more photos and selfies at the memorial.

""We have been to this place dozens of times. Earlier it lacked the grandeur. I hope this will be maintained and people will also keep it clean and avoid littering,"" said Rakesh Awasthi who was visiting the place with his family.

However, some visitors missed the boating facility in the water bodies along the lawns.

""I do not see any boats now. Hope they will be here soon since children like them very much,"" said a security guard near one of the water bodies where a ticket kiosk existed earlier.

Officials said there is a plan to allow boating at two water bodies one close to Krishi Bhawan and the other near the upcoming Vanijya Bhawan.

The water bodies are a part of the landscape of the avenue. Under the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project, the water bodies have been rebuilt with reinforced edges while redstone pavements have been built along it. Aerators and dissolved air flotation systems have been fitted to keep the water clean.

Another big draw at the spot was cultural performances by artistes from all over the country.

A large number of people gathered at a stage set up near India Gate, keenly watching Naurta and Kalbelia folk dances and lauding each performance.

After inaugurating Kartavya Path, Modi urged people to visit it and take selfies with it and upload them on social media. New signages bearing the new nomenclature of the ceremonial boulevard have been put up on the streetsides.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, also envisages a common central secretariat, a new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president enclave.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday evening inaugurated the revamped 3-km-long Central Vista Avenue, which extends from Rashtrapati Bhawan to the India Gate. The tree-lined space flanked by green spaces and water channels is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi and is best known for the annual parade.

PM Modi also unveiled the 28-feet black granite statue of Subhas Chandra Bose, which is placed under the India Gate canopy. The statue is hand-sculpted by a team led by renowned sculptor Arun Yogiraj from a single block of granite stone weighing 280 metric tonne. The block of stone was brought to Delhi from Telangana and it took two months to carve the statue of Bose from it.

The avenue was named Kingsway by the British after King George V, who visited Delhi during the Delhi Durbar of 1911 and shifted the capital from Calcutta to the city. Post-Independence, it was renamed Rajpath. A road bisecting the Kingsway was named Queensway. It is now known as Janpath.

Now Rajpath has once again been renamed as Kartavya Path, which translates to path of duty. This is the first project that has been completed under the Modi government's larger ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.

The redevelopment project of the nation's power corridor envisages a new triangular Parliament building, 10 buildings of the Common Central Secretariat, revamping the Rajpath, a new prime minister's residence and office, a new vice-president's enclave, Central Conference Centre, Additional Buildings for National Archives, among others.

Conceived in September 2019, the planned redevelopment is estimated to cost Rs 20,000 crore and involves projects spread over 6 years till 2026.

The project for the New Parliament Building was awarded at an estimated cost of Rs 862 crore to Tata Projects. The project for rejuvenation of Central Vista Avenue was awarded at an estimated cost of Rs 477 crore to Shapoorji Pallonji Group.

Larsen & Toubro bagged the contract for the construction and maintenance of the first three of the 10 buildings of the Common Central Secretariat. In October 2019, architect Bimal Patel's Gujarat-based firm HCP Design had won the consultancy bid for the Central Vista redevelopment.

The consultancy services include master plan, building designs, cost estimation, landscape and traffic integration plans and parking facilities.

HCP has developed several projects including Sabarmati Riverfront Development, Central Vista and state secretariat in Gandhinagar, Mumbai Port Complex, redevelopment of Varanasi temple complex, IIM Ahmedabad's new campus and CII-SN Centre of Excellence Kolkata etc.

Recently, Hyderabad-based DEC Infrastructure emerged as the lowest bidder for building the Executive Enclave that will house the PMO, the Cabinet Secretariat, the India House and the National Security Council Secretariat. It had quoted an amount of around Rs 1,189 crore.

The government in August said that 70% of work on the new Parliament building project has been achieved and the targeted date of completion is November 2022. The new Rajya Sabha hall is being built with a capacity of 384 seats while the new Lok Sabha hall will have 770 seats, with an additional capacity of up to 1134 seats for hosting joint sessions. The Vice President's enclave is expected to be completed by January 2023.",What change does Central Vista bring to India's corridors of power? | Business Standard News,9,2022

""Workers working on the new building will get a place of honour in one of the galleries,"" he said.

At the event, Modi also met a group of sixteen workers, who were engaged in the redevelopment of the entire stretch, and invited them along with their families as special guests on the 2023 Republic Day Parade.

""The Shramjeevis of Central Vista and their families will be my special guests on the next Republic Day Parade,"" the prime minister said.

Modi expressed ""special gratitude"" to the workers not just for their physical contribution to the redevelopment of Kartavya Path but also for being a living and breathing example of ""Kartavya"" (duty) towards the nation.

Talking about his meeting with the workers, the prime minister praised them for carrying a dream for the nation's glory in their hearts.

Modi said that today there is a tradition of respect for Shram (labour) and Shramjeevi (workers) in the country, and with the emphasis on sensitivity in policies, there has now come a sensitivity in decisions, and Shramev Jayate' is becoming a mantra for the nation.

Speaking at the event, he recalled instances of his interactions with workers in Kashi Vishwanath Dham, INS Vikrant, and Prayagraj Kumbh.

Infrastructure firm Tata Projects Ltd is constructing a new building as part of the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

The government plans to hold the Winter Session of Parliament in the new building.

Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new building in December 2020.

Last month, he unveiled the emblem cast on the roof of the building.

The new Parliament building will have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for MPs, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.

The redevelopment of the Central Vista, the nation's power corridor, also envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, a new office and residence of the prime minister, and a new vice-president enclave.

Speaking after unveiling a 28-foot statue of Netaji and inaugurating Kartavya Path, the stretch of road from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate -- earlier known as Rajpath, Modi said the renaming has given the country new energy and inspiration. 'Netaji's statue at India Gate will inspire and guide us,' he said. The revamped stretch is part of the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.

'We took many decisions in the last eight years which have imprints of Netaji's ideals and dreams,' said Modi.

He also said the changes undertaken by the government are not just limited to symbols but are now part of policies. He thanked workers involved in the development of Kartavya Path and said that they not only built it but also showed others ways of 'kartavya' (duty).

From witnessing the dawn of independence to playing host to annual Republic Day celebrations for over seven decades, the historic Rajpath has seen colonial rule and basked in the glory of a free, democratic nation.

The ceremonial boulevard of the capital was built after the imperial seat of the administration was shifted from Calcutta (now Kolkata) as announced by British monarch King George V in 1911. Soon after independence, Kingsway was renamed Rajpath, and Queensway running perpendicular to it was rechristened Janpath.

Rajpath has been the venue of all Republic Day celebrations since 1951. Only the first Republic Day celebrations were held at Irwin Stadium (now Major Dhyan Chand Stadium) behind the India Gate complex.

The Rajpath and the Central Vista lawns flanking the promenade were officially renamed Kartavya Path, as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) approved the renaming and issued a public notice in this regard on Wednesday.

Nearly 5,898 workers are working on-site and 1,491 workers are working off-site in the ambitious projects which comprise construction of the new Parliament building, Central Vista Avenue, Defence offices complexes and GPOA II (General Pool Office Accommodation) at KG Marg.

As per government information, construction of the Central Vista Projects has given employment to 3,235 skilled manpower and 4,138 semi skilled manpower.

The data said that so far 41,114 MT steel and over 1.01 lakh MT cement, 18235 and cubic meter fly ash have been used in the construction of the project.

The objective of the Central Vista Development/Redevelopment Master Plan is to improve the productivity and efficiency of administration by providing it with highly functional and purpose-designed office infrastructure. Some of the emergent governance benefits shall include combining all 51 Central Government Ministries in 10 Common Central Secretariat buildings allowing for easy movement of personnel, documents and goods, thereby increasing administrative efficiency.

The proximity and ease of inter-departmental movement, along with flexible and modular floor plans will enable the government to function in a more efficient and productive manner. Major increase in office spaces will offset the huge gap in present and future demand and existing availability. It will create modern workspaces with latest technology for better productivity and efficient utilization of human resources.

The infrastructure and facilities will be built at par with global standards. The redevelopment project will augment efforts towards sustainable development, with the construction of green buildings and clean transportation. Overall, redevelopment will trigger efficiency and synergy in the Government functioning.

The Prime Minister's Office, Residence and Vice President Residence are proposed to be built near the South Block and North Block respectively, in proximity to the Parliament and Common Central Secretariat, which would help in addressing security and logistic arrangements in a comprehensive manner, without interfering with the regular movement of traffic.

Prime Minister will inaugurate the redeveloped Central Vista Avenue, which is expected to open to the public on September 9.

However, the New Municipal Corporation (NDMC) said that a council meeting on the renaming would be held on September 7, according to a report by The Hindu.

Rajpath is the boulevard that runs from the Rashtrapati Bhawan to Vijay Chowk and India Gate and ends at Purana Qila. In the early 20th century, it was named by the British as ""Kingsway"" after King George V, who visited during the Durbar of 1911 and shifted the capital from Calcutta to the city.

The Viceroy's house was built on Raisina Hill overlooking the Kingsway till Purana Qilla. With a view of to the left and Safdurjung's Tomb to the right, the view from the house of the Viceroy was to comprise all objects of historical interest in the city.

A road bisecting the Kingsway was named Queensway. It is now known by the name of Janpath.

Post India's independence in 1947, the Central Vista was chosen as the centre of Delhi and renamed Rajpath.

At one point in time, according to a report by The Indian Express, Congress leaders suggested converting the entire area into hospitals. ""The Viceregal House and other similar buildings should be used as hospitals...we do not want any pomp and splendour, but a state has to keep up with a certain dignity as a state,"" Sushila Nayar, a disciple of Mahatama Gandhi wrote to Nehru.

However, later it was chosen as the place where the Republic Day parade would be organised.

Now, with the government's decision, the Rajpath will be called Kartavya Path.",What's in a name? Rajpath's journey from Kingsway to Kartavya Path | Business Standard News,9,2022

The New Municipal Council (NDMC) has convened a special meeting on September 7 and the proposal will be placed before it. ""The entire road and area from the Netaji statue at India Gate to the will be known as Kartavyapath,"" sources said.

Rajpath was known as Kingsway during British Rule.

In his Independence Day speech this year, the prime minister stressed the abolition of symbols that reflect the colonial mindset.

The prime minister has stressed on the importance of everyone fulfilling their duties in the 25 years leading to 2047 when India will be celebrating 100 years of Independence. Both these factors can be seen behind the name 'Kartavya Path', sources said, adding ""this is also a message to the ruling class that the era of rulers and subjects is over"".

Going by the ethos of the Modi government to make nomenclatures more people-centric, the name of the road on which the prime minister's residence is located was changed from Race Course Road to Lok Kalyan Marg in 2015, they added.

In 2015, Aurangzeb Road was renamed A P J Abdul Kalam Road. In 2017, Dalhousie Road was renamed Dara Shikoh Road. Also, Teen Murti Teen Murti Chowk was changed to Teen Murti Haifa Chowk in 2018. There have been several proposals to rename Akbar Road, but nothing has been done yet.

The redevelopment project of the Central Vista the nation's power corridor also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, a new residence of the prime minister, a prime minister's office, and a new vice-president's enclave.

The revamped Central Vista Avenue along the Rajpath will have state-wise food stalls, red granite walkways with greenery all around, vending zones, parking lots and round-the-clock security. But people would miss only one thing -- food will not be allowed on the lawns from India Gate to Man Singh Road.

The stretch will open for the public after 20 months. On the day of the inauguration, visitors will not be allowed on the stretch from the India Gate to Man Singh Road, but they can use the remaining part. From September 9, the entire stretch will be thrown open to the public.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), an executing agency of the project, has set up five vending zones where 40 vendors each will be allowed and according to the plan, they will not be allowed to sell their items to visitors in the garden area.

A senior official said there would be two blocks near the India Gate and each block has eight shops, adding that some states have shown their interest to set up their food stalls.

""Ice cream carts will only be allowed in the vending zones. Although we have not taken any decision, we will ensure that these ice cream trolleys are not allowed along roads,"" the official said.
